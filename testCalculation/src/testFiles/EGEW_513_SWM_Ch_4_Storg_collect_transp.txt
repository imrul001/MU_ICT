Collection Vehicles• Solid Waste Transportation– Collection Routes• Cost of Waste Collection and Transportation2Solid Waste Storage• The four core elements of any solid waste managementsystem are:» storage,» collection,» transportation, and finally» the treatment/disposal of the wastes• The efficiency and effectiveness of the system depends oneach of these components.• Compatibility (matching) between the first three steps, i.e.storage, collection, and transport is essential to ensureoptimum operation.34.1 On‑Site Storage•On‑site storage refers to the storage and handling of thewastes at or near the points of generation before they arecollected and transported to the treatment/disposaldestinations.•On‑site storage of municipal solid wastes is of primaryimportance because of its implications on handling of thewastes during the loading operation into collectionvehicles.•While selecting the equipments and methods of on‑sitestorage, many factors have to be considered, e.g., publichealth concerns, aesthetics, environmental pollution, andthe economic situation.4• Public health concerns are primarily related to theinfestation of the areas used for storage of solid wasteswith flies, insects and rodents, etc., which are the potentialthreats to human health.• Aesthetic considerations are related to the odors or foulsmells, and the unsightly conditions created by the lack ofsanitary maintenance of the storage operations.• Economics involved in the on‑site storage of wastes is themajor controlling factor for the choices to be made.• However, the main criteria for the selection of on‑sitestorage containers should be the human and environmentalsafety.5• By far the most effective control measure for theinfestation of rodents, insects, and flies, is the propersanitation.• This can be achieved through:– the use of containers of appropriate size with tight lids;– periodic washing and scrubbing of the containers as well as of thestorage area;– regular use of disinfectants to spray the containers; and– removal of wastes with reasonable collection frequency.• On‑site solid waste storage may be classified as:1) primary storage (or individual storage)2) secondary storage (or communal storage)61) Primary Waste Storage• Primary waste storage refers to the storage at thelow‑volume waste sources, e.g.,» individual homes,» small isolated commercial premises,» walkways in parks and other public places, and» low‑rise residential areas with set out collectionservice.• Owners and tenants of the premises are responsible for thecontainers to store their daily garbage.• For public places, the municipal authorities provide therefuse receptacles (waste storage containers) at thepredetermined locations.7• In most Asian countries a variety of receptacles are used byindividuals for primary on‑site storage within or near theirpremises.• These range from temporary containers e.g.» paper and plastic carrier bags» cardboard boxesor comparatively permanent ones e.g.» used metal or plastic tins,» plastic buckets,» bamboo baskets etc.• Size of these garbage containers are usually small with atypical capacity range of 20‑40 gallons (90‑180 liters).8• In Bangkok, baskets and plastic bins are used for refusestorage in individual houses.• In Colombo and Jakarta, improvised oil drums or similarmetal containers are used.• Cheap, temporary kinds are used in unserviced or poorlyserviced areas and permanent kinds, in high income urbanareas.• In many developing Asian countries, the domestic orhousehold wastes are still dumped into open piles onpathways to be collected by the municipal service.• Many of the primary waste storage facilities are notprovided with the lids and therefore are susceptible to odorand breeding of flies.9• Also there are severe problems in educating public to useproper storage containers.• Figs 4.1-4.2 presents some typical household and otherprimary on‑site waste storage containers in use in Asianregion.• Common problems and limitations with the primarystorage containers used in most Asian countries include:» containers are damaged over time, and degraded inappearance and capacity;» containers are not large enough to accommodate thewastes causing spilling and littering of the refuse.10Fig 4.1 On-site primary‑storage waste containers used in Asian countries11Figure 4.2 On-site primary Solid Waste Storage Containers122) Secondary Waste Storage• Secondary waste storage refers to the medium to highvolume sources that might also have bulky wastes.• These include high‑ density residential, commercial, andindustrial areas with the direct collection service throughthe refuse collection trucks access; and the low‑densityrural residential areas with less frequent collectionservices.• Municipal authorities are responsible for providing therefuse storage receptacles and selecting the locations forplacing these containers.• Communal waste storage facilities may be eitherstationary or portable receptacles.13• The stationary receptacles range from: depots, enclosures,fixed bins, and concrete sections.• The most common ones are:>uncovered masonry enclosures with capacities between1‑5 cu m (1,000‑5,000 liters);>covered galvanized metal or masonry bins withcapacities up to 2000 liters and access for loading at thetop and unloading through a side flap door; and>concrete pipe sections with capacities up to 300 liters.• All three types of facilities have been in use in the Asiancountries and have failed consistently.14• Often the Waste is scattered around the facilities, andinsects, rodents and animals are attracted to it.• Except for covered bins, no protection is provided againstrain.• However, 2000 liter drum storage is gaining popularityand widely used in Asian countries.• A few Asian cities have demonstrated that these drumscan be successfully used with proper management e.g.>>>>drums being painted inside with bitumen paint;locations carefully selected, paved and provided withpartial fencing;quick replacement of damaged bins;daily collection.15• Secondary or communal storage practices in Asiancountries need immediate attention for improvement as thisis the only way to ensure optimum waste collection.• Only wealthier countries may be in a position to introducecommunal storage containers which are mechanicallycleared and emptied.• Most developing countries, where even communal systemsare still far from practice in rural areas, can only affordmanual operation of communal storage facilities and locallymanufactured simple containers as a means of storage.16Storage of Wastes from Streets and Park Pathways• A variety of storage receptacles are used in Asian countriesfor street wastes and wastes from other public places, e.g.walkways in parks, etc.• These include: large size bamboo baskets, used oil drums,metallic liter bins, and stone containers, etc.• Larger litter bins are up to 100 liter capacity while the smallerbins are of 30‑50 liters as shown in Fig 4.3.• The litter bins are usually made of two parts‑the outer one ofstandard design and color and a separate inner part for liftingand emptying.17Figure 4.3 Litter bins18• There has been a tendency to recommend that primary andsecondary storage facilities should be of a surplus capacityof:>at least 50% in excess when collection is daily, and>100% in excess for six‑days‑a‑week collection.• This requirement, however, seems somewhat excessiveand less cost‑effective.• More practically, except in the case of communalcontainers not attended by municipal workers, a capacityof 33% in excess for daily collection and 66% forsix‑days‑a‑week collection should be provided for bothprimary and secondary storage facilities.19Commercial and Industrial Wastes• Commercial and industrial wastes are generally stored in awide range of 90 to 15,000 liter containers.• Bulk containers of size 4,000‑15,000 liters are morecommon in the industrialized countries.• Most of these systems are organized privately with refusereceptacles generally being provided by contractors or thecompanies themselves.204.2 Source Separation• The separation of solid waste components including»»»»»wastepaper,cardboard,aluminum cans,glass, andplastic containersat the source of generation is one of the most positive andeffective ways to achieve the recovery and reuse ofmaterials.• Once the waste components are separated, the questionfacing the homeowner is what to do with the wastes untilthey are collected or taken to local buy-back or recycling21center.• Some homeowners store the separated components withinthe home, periodically transferring the accumulatedwastes to larger containers.• Other homeowners prefer to take separated wastecomponents and place them directly in the containers usedfor the storage of these materials.22Solid Waste Collection and Transportation• Collection of the solid wastes from the storage points fortransportation to the treatment/disposal sites, is the mostimportant component of any waste management system.• Together, collection and transportation of wastes consumethe biggest portion of the total expenditure.• Therefore, planning and implementation of this componentshould be done with utmost care.234.3 Collection Rates and Coverage• Solid wastes in any urban or rural community that arecollected for disposal by the municipal authorities includecommingled wastes or source separated wastes.• In many cities of Asian and other developing countries, themunicipal governments have the primary responsibility forcollection of solid wastes (MSW) but often lack thecapabilities to manage this waste.• Failure to collect 100% of the municipal solid wastes thatare generated in any city is common.24• Although any ideal system aims at 100% collection of thewastes generated, in reality it is almost impossible toaccomplish.• The difference between the amount of residential andcommercial MSW generated may vary from city to city inany country.• In most Asian countries, collection rate or coverage rangesfrom 60‑90% in urban areas of major cities and about40‑50% in rural areas.• Obtaining the actual figures is again very difficult as onlyfew countries keep the records of such data.• In any developed country like USA, 85-95% collection ratesare common.25• Among some Asian countries, 90% of urban waste iscollected by municipal crews and private contractors inMalaysia.• About 71% of total waste generated in Metro Manila iscollected by government operators and about 14% by theprivate collectors.• In Thailand, both public and private services for MSWcollection are provided.• About 80% of waste generated in most Thai cities arecollected regularly, however collection services are not ashigh in rural areas.• The remaining waste is left in areas inaccessible tocollection trucks or thrown into drains, canals, and rivers.264.4 Collection Methods• Various methods of solid waste collection are practiced indeveloping countries and may be classified mainly underfour categories:» Door‑to‑door Collection» Block Collection» Curbside Collection or Alley Pickup» Communal Collection271) Door‑to‑door Collection•As the name implies, in this method collection crew has tocollect waste from each household.•There are some aspects of this method to be considered inview of the situations in developing countries.•Cities in most Asian countries are outgrowths of smalltowns with narrow streets and crowded residentialdistricts.•This poses a number of problems e.g. difficulty inaccessibility to the premises, lack of adequate spacearound the houses, etc.•Adoption of this method of waste collection is thuslimited to some areas in most Asian cities.28• In many cities, waste is collected from individual houses insmaller, manually operated vehicles and is transferred laterto collection vehicles for hauling.2) Block Collection• This method of collection is used in few Asian countries e.g.Burma, Philippines, China, and Taiwan.• Under this system, a collection vehicle travels apredetermined route at prescribed intervals, usually everytwo to three days, and stops at selected locations and a bellis sounded.• Upon hearing the bell, householders bring their refusecontainers and hand them over to the crew which emptiesthe containers and returns them to the owners.29• No containers are left outside household premises or oncommunal land.• Vehicle and labor productivity of this system lies betweenlow to medium.3) Curbside Collection or Alley Pickup• In this method, the householders are responsible for placingthe refuse containers at the curb on the scheduled days,when collection vehicle comes and the crew collects andempties the containers in the vehicle and places them backat the curb.• Residents are required to take back the empty containers totheir homes.30• This system requires a very regular and well‑organizedcollection service, so that householders know when to leavetheir wastes at the curb.• Where collection is irregular, it is common to see the refusecontainers placed permanently outside, with increasedincidence of the scattering of wastes by scavenging animals(dogs and cats).• Curbside collection is practiced in only high income areasof the developing Asian countries and is not economical inlow and medium income areas.• Another version of the curbside collection can be seen inAsian cities in which people just throw away their trashoutside their premises from where it is collected by themunicipal street sweepers along with the street sweepings.314) Communal Collection• This is the most common mode of solid waste collection inAsian countries.• Under this system:» householders discharge their wastes at the communalstorage facilities and» refuse‑collection vehicles visit these sites at regularintervals, usually once daily, to remove accumulatedwaste.• Theoretically, the main advantage of this collection methodis that it reduces considerably the number of collectionpoints and thus economizing the system.324.4 Collection Frequency• Frequency of waste collection varies not only from countryto country or city to city but also from district to district ofthe same city.• Daily collection of domestic and commercial solid wastes ispracticed in most Asian metropolitan cities.• Some Asian countries still do not have any fixed collectionschedules.334.5 Collection Vehicles• The waste collection system includes the collection ofwastes from specific collection points e.g. community bins,and transportation to the processing and/or disposal sites byusing refuse collection vehicles and collection crew.• In Asian countries, a variety of refuse collection vehicles arein use.• In general, these vehicles can be grouped into 2 types:(i) Vehicles which move through narrow streets and do nottravel a long distance before unloading their contents at atransfer station, processing or disposal facility.(ii) Vehicles which move through wider roads and travel longdistances before discharging their contents at processing ordisposal sites.34• In Asian countries, both types of vehicles are used.• A combination of short distance type vehicles to transportthe wastes to the transfer stations where the load may bedischarged into another set of vehicles for long distancehauling to the treatment/disposal facilities, gives optimumresults.• Waste‑collection vehicles may be classified according tofour main characteristics:>>>>power source,vehicle body,loading speed, andvehicle size.35• A variety of power sources are available, including humanand animal power, and a large range of prime movers e.g.three‑wheeled auto rickshaws, dumper trucks,tractor‑trailers and conventional trucks.• The most appropriate power source will often bedetermined by many factors e.g.:>>>>>quantity and nature of waste,haul distance,road width and condition,traffic situation, andfunds availability.36• Based on power source, vehicles can grouped in twocategories:>non‑motorized>motorized vehicleswhich can further be divided into different types.• Among the motorized vehicles in use in some newlyindustrialized Asian countries, the various types include:» compactor vehicles,» non‑compaction vehicles,» semi‑compaction vehicles, and» container‑handling systems.37• Many Asian countries now practice a widespread use ofcompactor vehicles in major cities.• However, compactor trucks will prove uneconomical forthe countries where refuse densities as well as organiccontents are high.• Figs 4.4-4.5 shows various kinds of refuse collectionvehicles used in Asian countries.38Collection truck with CompactorSide loading TruckSmall truck with compactorLarge truck with compactorsFigure 4.4 Refuse collection vehicles used in Asian CountriesSide –loaded truckContainer hauling truckFigure 4.5 Refuse collection vehicles used in Asian Countries4.6 Manpower (Collection Crew Size)• Collection vehicle productivity or the efficiency ofcollection system is best maximized by optimizing thecollection crew size so that overall vehicle and labor costare minimized.• The optimum crew size varies from city to city and fromdistrict to district within a city.• Factors affecting the optimum crew size include:» physical density and layout of the area,» method of collection and» relative hourly costs of labor and vehicle.• The greater the crew size, the greater will be the numberof bins emptied daily by the vehicle.41• However, increasing the crew size does imply increasedoperational costs.• Not only that, labor productivity has also been observed todiminish with increase in crew size.• Not only that, labor productivity has also been observed todiminish with increase in crew size.• There is, however, an optimum crew size which willminimize overall operational costs.• This optimum can only be established through undertakingdetailed time‑and‑motion studies for different areas.42• Following such a study, it will be possible to establish thecost of labor per unit‑quantity of waste collected fordifferent crew sizes.• In countries where labor is cheap and machinery expensive,as is common in majority of Asian developing countries,increasing crew size will usually reduce overallwaste‑collection costs.• The usual collection crew size in Asian countries consists of3‑4 workers, although crews of as few as 2 or as many as 8have been observed.• In some instances, the crew may be increased byunauthorized individuals who participate in the collectionactivity to increase the extent of material recovery.43• The usual situation in fact is that the collection activity ischaracterized by excessive handling and use of inefficientmethods.• The problem in countries like India and Nepal is that peoplebelonging to only certain specific communities carry outthis work.• This in turn makes the system completely dependent on agroup of people.• Therefore, any measures to improve low efficiency of thesepeople are often not successful.444.7 Solid Waste Transportation• Transportation of the wastes after being collected from allcollection points, is the next step which has to be plannedcarefully to optimize the efficiency and economics of thewaste management system.• The important factors to be considered include:» road conditions used for waste transportation,» traffic density,» and above all, the overall haul (transport) distance.• These factors also have determining influence on the choiceof :» collection vehicle,» crew size, and» the transportation routes.45• There is little point in using high‑speed vehicles insituations where haul distances are short and traffic speedsare slow.• The haul distance vary from city to city or from district todistrict.• Small, maneuverable and easy‑to‑load machines need tobecompared with large, cumbersome machines but will makefew trips to the dumping site.• The overall haul distance will also determine the need fortransfer stations to transfer wastes from smallmaneuverable vehicles to large trucks, containers, railwagons or barges for transport to distant disposal sites. 46• Two kinds of transportation mode are usually employed inthe Asian countries:(1) Direct Haul(2) Waste Transfer Stations1) Direct Haul• In this method wastes are directly transported fromcollection points to the final disposal site.• Generally this mode is used when the haul distance does notexceed 20 km.• The distance between the urban areas dumps and theircollection areas in most developing Asian countries lieswithin this range.• Non‑ compaction, semi‑compaction, and compactionvehicles are designed to haul wastes directly.472) Waste Transfer• The transfer of collected waste from one vehicle to anothermay be useful to optimize vehicle productivity and reduceoverall system costs.• Similarly, transfer stations for temporary storage of wastesbefore being transported to final disposal site can prove tobe optimum in terms of:» cost,» Energy,» manpower,» time.48• Generally, if the traveling time to the point of disposal isequivalent to or larger than half the daily loading time, aform of transfer might be justified.• There are two basic waste‑transfer practices:(i) short‑range transfer involving non‑motorized vehicles andsmallcapacity motorized vehicles, e.g. auto‑rickshaws and dumpertrucks.(ii) long‑range transfer involving vehicles such as conventionalrefuse‑collection trucks.49(i) Short‑range Transfer Vehicles•Vehicles used for short range transfer are function of thetype of the transfer stations.•There are three types of short‑range transfer station,varying in sophistication and serving different purposes.(a) non‑containerized(b) containerized(c) compacting transfer stations50(a) Non‑containerized Transfer Stations• This is the most primitive form of transfer station, wherewaste collected in primary, short‑range vehicles isdischarged at a site, usually with a concrete floor andenclosed.• Subsequently, the waste is transferred to secondary,long‑range vehicles for transportation to the disposal site.• The transfer operation is usually undertaken manually orwith the use of a front‑end‑loader tractor.• This form of transfer facility although still used in someparts of Asia, is not recommended.51• It is excessively demanding in labor and, where front‑endloaders are used, in capital and fuel.• The mode of operation of transfer facility is also contrary tothe fundamental principle of solid waste management whichis to ensure that wastes never come into contact with theground.(b) Containerized Transfer Station• In this type of transfer station, waste collected inprimary‑collection vehicles is discharged directly intocontainers, generally with 8‑25 m3 capacity, which are thentransported directly to the disposal site.52• In its simplest form, the facility consists of just onecontainer at a level site with adequate space for depositing asecond empty container prior to picking up a full one.• There might be no more than a half‑wall enclosure alongthecurbside.• Non‑motorized vehicles are productively deployed to feedthese containers, and each container covers a zone withinthe settlement.• A single vehicle or tractor shuttles between 3‑8 suchcontainers to the disposal site daily.53• The second type of containerized transfer station consists ofan enclosure on a level site, with two independentunidirectional traffic routes for the primary and secondarycollection vehicles.• Containers collected by primary‑collection vehicles aredeposited in the space between the vehicle routes for pickup by a large vehicle capable of transporting a number ofsuch containers.• The third type of containerized transfer station consists ofan enclosed, split‑level where primary‑collection vehiclesdischarge from a platform directly into an open containerlocated below.54• Space might be allocated for one or more suchcontainers and a single vehicle might shuttle severalsuch containers to the disposal site each day.(c) Compaction Transfer Station• As implied by its name, the compaction‑transferstation uses a fixed hydraulic compacting unit tocompress the waste into large containers, usually 8‑30m3.• This type of transfer station is only relevant forhandling low‑density refuse and, because of theirlarge capital cost, they are rarely cost‑ effective foruse in developing countries.55(ii) Long‑range Transfer• Where the waste‑disposal site is located at a considerabledistance from the collection area (usually over 20 km),productivity of waste‑collection vehicles and associatedlabor cannot be assured without use of some form oflong‑range transfer station.• In some circumstances, the motive behind usinglong‑rangetransfer stations might be to take the opportunity to usealternative energy‑efficient secondary‑transport vehicles.56• There are primarily 3 types of long‑range transfer stationwhich can be classified, by the nature of their secondarytransport mode, as:» road transfer stations,» rail transfer stations, and» barge transfer stations.• These vehicles have a capacity of handling a minimum of20 to 40 tons per load.574.8 Collection and Transportation Routes• Collection and transportation routes along which thevehicles move during operations form an integral part ofthe solid waste management system.• Once the equipment and labor requirements have beendetermined, collection routes must be laid out so that bothwork force and equipment are used effectively and thesystem's efficiency is maximized.• One of the main problems encountered by the Asiancountries is the accumulation of the uncollected solidwastes which is due to the decreasing collection efficiency.58• One way of increasing collection efficiency is to increasethe vehicle productivity to select and plan routes so that thequantity of waste collected daily is maximized.• In majority of the Asian countries, collection routes veryrarely are predetermined.• On the contrary, the general practice is to leave themake‑up of the route to the discretion of the driver or thesupervisor at the site.• Consequently, it is not uncommon to find a truck arrivingat the disposal site only partially loaded, primarily becauseof improper routing.• This results in imbalance in cleaning schedule and alsounnecessarily increases the transportation cost.59• In many cases, after the collection vehicle has beenloaded to capacity or the collection route has beencovered, the trip to the disposal site is madeunnecessarily long, so as to include an opportunity tounload a part or even most of the load for use asanimal feed or for some monetary gain from recovery ofuseful materials.• Three fundamental approaches of collection vehiclerouting are:>heuristic,>deterministic, and>deterministic‑heuristic methods.60• Steps involved in the first approach include:>the preparation of location maps showing wastegeneration and collection points and quantities ofwastes;>and identification of preliminary routes which should beupdated to balance through trial and error.• The deterministic approach relies on operations researchtechniques and the development of mathematical modelsincorporating relevant local data to determine the optimumroute.• The heuristic‑deterministic approach identifies a number ofoptions, and then for existing constraints, the most feasiblesolution is determined.614.9 Cost of Collection and Transportation• In most Asian countries, like other developing nations of theworld, the local governments always fail to assume theirbasic responsibility to raise sufficient funds to provide anacceptable level of service.• One of the reasons is the inadequate funds made availablefor solid waste management which often receives the lowestpriority among the various municipal services.• Moreover, even the limited funds available are frequentlyused to acquire inadequate and often inappropriatecollection equipment or to maintain an insufficient, obsoletecollection fleet.62• The absence of adequate planning and the use ofinappropriate technology have led to a serious wastage ofexpenditure and effort in this direction.• Of the total expenditure incurred in solid‑waste‑management, 70 to 80 percent is directed towards thecollection and transportation of wastes.• Thus, the efficiency of this sector, to a large extent, governsthe efficiency of solid waste service.• Hence, the objective of an efficient service should be theminimization of waste collection and transportation costs,with the maintenance of an adequate and regular service.63• Because the monetary expenditure for solid wastemanagement services is high, even by the standardsprevailing in industrialized nations, the municipalitygenerally must subsidize a large percentage of the cost.• One reason of inadequate funds is that the solid wastecleansing tax is commonly levied as a percentage ofproperty tax.• The rates are found to be quite low and a rational tariffstructure does not exist.• The collection of taxes is normally very low mainly becauseof lack of proper organization and incentives for collections.64• The fines for non‑payment of taxes are also very nominaland the process for its recovery involves lengthyprocedures.• It is now well known that the penalty for poor or inadequatemanagement of solid wastes in Asian cities is the high costof the services provided.• Indeed, the surprisingly high cost of waste management isdue to a shortage of trained personnel and the absence ofplanning• It has also become apparent that the services are frequentlydiverted to political or personal ends.65• The result is an increase in the labor force beyond the sizenormally needed for waste management.• There are two components of the waste collection cost:>labor>machinery• In most Asian countries, like other developing ones, laboris cheap and so wages are lower as compared to vehiclecost.• Consequently, vehicle costs predominate in overall systemcosts.66• Therefore, optimization of vehicle productivity inpreference to labor productivity is required.• This means that the aim of an optimum waste collectionsystem should be to maximize the total tonnage of wastetransported per vehicle per day in preference to the totaltonnage of waste collected per worker per day.• Table 4.1 shows the manpower, solid waste transportationrates i.e. quantity of wastes transported per worker per day,and collection costs for some Asian countries.• Table 4.2 shows the reported collection costs for somecountries.67Table 4.1 Solid Waste Collection Manpower and expenditure in Some Asian Countries68Table 4.2 Solid Waste Management Components’ Costs in Some Countries69
