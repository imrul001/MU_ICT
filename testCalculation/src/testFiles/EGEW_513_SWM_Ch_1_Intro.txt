Solid Wastes – Definitions• Solid wastes are the inevitable (unavoidable)by‑products of life.• From a general definition point of view, any 'waste'is an unwanted 'thing' which needs to be disposed(thrown away).• Solid wastes are the waste materials in solid stateform.• These may contain any of the solid substances foundin nature as well as the man‑made (anthropogenic)3materials as a result of human activities.1.1 Solid Wastes – Definitions• Also, these may or may not be directly usable ordisposable, and may or may not createenvironmental pollution and other ecologicaldisturbances.• Some of the useful definitions of solid wastes foundin the terminology used in solid waste managementfield are as follows:• Garbage - solid wastes in every day usage.Sometimes, the term “garbage” is used to mean4"food waste," although this usage is not common.• Refuse - a term often used interchangeably withsolid waste.• Rubbish - a general term for solid waste,sometimes to exclude food wastes and ashes.• Trash - also, a term often used interchangeablywith solid waste, usually meaning paper, rags,cartons, boxes, wood, furniture, tree branches5Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW)• All solid wastes generated in an area (municipality)except industrial and agricultural wastes.• Sometimes defined to mean all solid wastes that acity authority accepts responsibility for managing insome way (Figure 1.1).• This may include construction and demolitiondebris, special wastes, and even hazardous wastes tothe extent that they enter the municipal wastestream.6Figure 1.1 Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW)71.2 Impact of Waste• Problems with the disposal of wastes can be tracedto the ancient times having a history of epidemicscaused by various disease carriers that breed ondecomposing wastes left mindlessly anywhere nearhuman populations.• The lack of any plan for the management of solidwastes had led to the epidemic of plague, the BlackDeath, that killed half of the 14th century Europeansand caused many subsequent epidemics with highdeath tolls.8• It was not until the 19th century (1800s) that publichealth officials became aware that food wastes hadto be collected and disposed of in a sanitary mannerto control rodents and flies, the vectors of disease.• The relationship between public health and theimproper storage, collection, and disposal of solidwastes is quite obvious.• It is well understood that rats, flies, and otherdisease vectors breed in open dumps, as well as inpoorly constructed and maintained housing, in foodstorage facilities, and in many other places.9• The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) publishedthe results of a study tracing the relationship of 22human diseases to improper solid wastemanagement.• Some forms of water and air pollution have alsobeen attributed to improper management of solidwastes.• For instance, liquid from dumps and poorlyengineered landfills has contaminated surface watersand ground waters.10• In mining areas, the liquid leached from wastedumps may contain toxic elements, such as copper,arsenic, and uranium.• Such leaching may contaminate water supplies.• Although nature has the capacity to dilute, disperse,degrade, absorb, or otherwise reduce the impact ofunwanted residues in the atmosphere, in waterways,and on the land, ecological imbalances haveoccurred where the natural assimilative capacity hasbeen exceeded.111.3 Magnitude of the Problem• Until about 35 years ago, managing solid wastes wasconsidered to be simply transporting waste tofaraway places and just dumping it on land thereindefinitely for nature to take care of it (Figure 1.2).• Today, with nearly 7 billions of people on our planetearth, there is not much space available toaccommodate the dumping of solid wastes that havemultiplied in unthinkable amount.• Moreover, the nature of the wastes has also changedso drastically that it is no longer safe for humans andthe environment to just leave the wastes as they are.12Figure 1.2 Solid Wastes Dumped on Land13• End products of modern hi‑tech processes in allwalks of life lead to wastes of very complex nature.• Due to the advancement of human civilization, solidwastes are no longer simple materials which canbreak down into easily degradable substances.• Other than being extremely non‑degradable theyalso include hazardous substances which pose aconstant threat to ourselves and our environment.• In short, the limited capacity of nature to dilute,disperse, degrade, absorb or otherwise dispose ofunwanted residues poses problems which only mancan resolve.14• Solid waste disposal creates a problem primarily inhighly populated areas.• The more concentrated the population, the greaterthe problem becomes.• Asian countries, like other developing countries,have often failed to pay attention to the task ofproperly managing the waste generated by them.• In recent years, the quality of the environment inmost developing countries has deteriorated to a levelat which it can no longer be ignored.15• In many cities, particularly in the metropolises ofmajor developing countries, the traditional solidwaste disposal practices are now beginning to showsigns of no longer functioning properly or workingeffectively.• The Asia‑Pacific region alone contains just overhalf of the world's population.• One of the most pressing problems in the Asiancountries is the lack of proper sanitation and wastedisposal programs.161.4 Current Awareness• Recently, as the situation in large metropolitan areasin Asian countries became intolerable, publicofficials became painfully aware of the closeinterrelationship between pollution control andpublic health.• Consequently, governments in many countries incooperation with certain international institutionsbegan to take steps to implement some pollutioncontrol measures.• Fortunately, quite a few Asian countries arerecognizing the need for carrying out wastemanagement programs.• Furthermore, public officials in these countriesrealize the close relationship between wastemanagement and proper functioning of othermunicipal services.• For instance, in the past, sewerage and drainageservices provided to urban areas ignored the factthat without a solid waste collection system,residents of the area would dispose their wastes indrainage canals and sewers which eventually wouldlead to the clogging of the sewers and anoverflowing by the canals.• At present, although the state of affairs in manyAsian countries still seems rather grim, it isbeginning to improve.• People in a position to do something are becomingaware of the dangers and problems of impropermanagement of solid wastes and of the urgency toinitiate remedial measures.• Not only are studies and surveys being made, butcourses of action are being drawn up and steps arebeing taken to follow them.1.5 Solid Waste Management (SWM)• Managing solid wastes includes the activities to makethem harmless to mankind and its environment.• Solid waste management (SWM) is required toaccomplish:» reduction in diseases» a more hygienic, safe and pollution‑freeenvironment» cleaner and more comfortable livingconditions, and a higher standard of living and» optimum utilization of resources.20• Solid waste management (SWM) aims at:» reducing the amount of waste generated at thesource» recycling the useful materials from the waste and» treating and disposing the non‑recyclable waste• The whole process includes:» the removal of all solid wastes discarded (thrownaway) by the people in a village, town, or city.» transporting them to a place where treatmentand/or final disposal can be done to eliminate anypotential hazards from the wastes21Elements of Solid Waste Management• From the systems point of view of functionalelements, solid waste management can be visualizedas the discipline associated with: (Figure 1.3)» identification of solid wastes including:sources, quantity, and composition;» on‑site storage;» collection;» transfer and transportation;» reduction, reuse and recycling (RRR);» intermediate treatment; and» final disposal.2223Figure 1.3 Functional Elements of Solid Waste Management• One of the objectives of the solid wastemanagement is to optimize these functionalelements to provide the most efficient andeconomic practices in accordance with the socioeconomic, environmental, technological andpolitical constraints.• By considering each element separately it ispossible to identify the fundamental aspects andrelationships involved in each element, and todevelop, wherever possible, quantifiablerelationships for the purposes of makingengineering comparisons, analysis and evaluation.
