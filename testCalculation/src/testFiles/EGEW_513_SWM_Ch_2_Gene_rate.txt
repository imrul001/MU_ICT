Solid Waste Generation RatesandCharacterizationDr. Ranjna Jindal1Lecture Outline• Generation Rates• Waste Characterization» Sources of Solid Wastes» Classification of Solid Wastes• Composition of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)• Determination of the Composition of MSW inthe Field22.1 Generation Rates• Solid waste generation rate of a city or town is the estimatedamount of wastes, usually in kilograms per person per day(kg/c/d = kg per capita per day).• Nearly all the countries of the world are now facing theproblem of dealing with growing mountains of solid wastes,especially in the big, bulging, and dynamic metropolitancities.• The first and the very basic factor affecting the quantity ofwastes in a country is the population.• Simply enough, more number of people will produce morewaste.3• Secondly, it is a well evident fact that the quantity of wastegenerated in a country is directly related to the degree ofdevelopment of the country.• Statistics show that the waste increases proportionally to theGNP (Gross National Product – an economic indicator) ofthe nation.• The total annual amount of solid wastes produced in acountry depends on many factors e.g.:» population of the country,» standard of living,» social and cultural traditions of the people,» degree of industrialization4• The per capita quantity of waste serves a better parameterfor the comparative view among various countries.• Municipal solid waste includes wastes generated inresidential and commercial areas and therefore becomesthe responsibility of the area municipal authority.• Wastes from industrial and agricultural operations areconsidered separately.• However, it is government's duty to enforce proper lawsand regulations with regards to the industrial and otherkinds of waste management.5• In addition to the waste produced in residential andcommercial premises, street waste is also included in themunicipal solid wastes.• Demolition and construction wastes are not normallyexpected to be dumped in the municipal collection bins andthe concerned parties are required to bring the materialdirectly to specific disposal sites for its disposal.• Industries produce different categories of wastes whichinclude those from processes, packaging, offices, canteenand plant.• Excluding the process solid waste, the remainingcategories can be and usually are disposed along withmunicipal wastes.6• Industrial processes solid wastes which are not of toxicnature, can be disposed at the common sites.• Industrial establishments are responsible for the storage,collection, and transportation to the disposal sites.• Agricultural wastes are normally not considered withinmunicipal limits.• However, similar types of wastes could be expected frominstitutional gardens, nurseries and experimental farmswithin municipal limits.• The quantity of municipal solid wastes generated can beassessed accurately in house to house collection system.7• Unfortunately, in most developing countries such system ispracticed only in selected parts of a few metropolitan citiesand therefore making it difficult to assess the quantitycorrectly.• Also, the quantity of waste measured at the disposal sitecan not be relied upon as it does not represent the totalamount of waste generated.• The per capita generation rates for some Asian countriesare given in Tables 2.1-2.28Table 2.1 Solid Waste Generation Rate of Some AsianCountriesCountryLarge citieskg/c/dMedium citieskg/c/dSmall townskg/c/d0.50.40.4-0.36-Hong Kong3.6--China1.59--India0.50.3-0.40.10.65-0.830.55-0.630.47-0.5Japan1.21.1-Korea2.8--Nepal0.40.2-0.3-Philippines0.5--Sri Lanka0.90.50.2Taiwan0.9--Thailand0.8-0.90.70.6BangladeshMyanmar (Burma)Indonesia9Table 2.2 Solid Waste Generation in Thailand from 1992-1999Solid Waste Generation (tons/day)Area199219931994199519961997199819991.

knowledge aboutthe sources and types (categories) of wastes as wellas information on the quantity and the compositionof wastes generated from each source is essential.• Based on the commonly adapted sourceclassification, the following waste categories aregenerally used:(1)(2)(3)(4)residentialcommercialinstitutionalconstruction and demolition162. 2 Waste Characterization2.2.1 Sources of Solid

wastes192.2.2 Classification of Solid Wastes• The general classification and description of wastesgenerated at each of the sources is presented asfollows:(i) Residential and Commercial Wastes• Solid wastes generated in the residential,commercial, and institutional parts of a communityare grouped in two kinds:(1) Organic Fraction of Wastes – (Combustibles)(2) Inorganic Fraction of Wastes – ( Incombustibles)20(1) Organic Fraction of Wastes – (Combustibles)• The organic fraction of residential and commercialwaste consists of materials such as:» Food waste (also called garbage)» Paper of all types» Cardboard (also called paperboard andcorrugated paper)» Plastics of all types» Textiles» Rubber» Leather» Wood and yard wastes21(2) Inorganic Fraction of Wastes – (Incombustibles)• The inorganic fraction consists of items such as» Glass» Crockery» tin cans» Aluminum» ferrous metals» dirtTerms Used for Some Categories of Municipal SolidWastes(a) Commingled Municipal Solid Wastes• If the waste components are not separated when discarded,then the mixture of these wastes is also known ascommingled MSW.22(b) Putrescible Waste• Wastes that will decompose rapidly, especially in warmweather, are also known as putrescible waste.• The principal source of putrescible wastes is the handling,preparation, cooking, and eating of foods.• Often, decomposition will lead to the development ofoffensive odors and breeding of flies and other diseasevectors.• Apart from the above mentioned categories of solid wastesfound in residential and commercial areas, there are twomore kinds of wastes generated at these sources:(c) Special Wastes(d) Hazardous Wastes23(c) Special Wastes• Special wastes from residential and commercial sourcesinclude:» Bulky Items: large worn-out or broken household,commercial, and industrial items such asfurniture, lamps, bookcases, filingcabinets, and other similar items» Consumer worn-out, broken and other no longerElectronics:wanted items such as radios, stereos,andtelevision sets» WhiteGoods:large stoves, refrigerators, dishwaters,and clothes washers and dryers.Collected separately, white goods areusually dismantled for the recovery ofspecific materials (e.g. aluminum, etc.)24» UsedThe principal sources of batteries areBatteries:from households and automobiles andother vehicle serving facilities.Household batteries come in a variety of types,including alkaline, mercury, silver, zinc, nickel, andcadmium.The metals found in discarded batteries found in MSWcan cause groundwater contamination through leachatefrom landfills.They can also be found in air emissions and ash fromwaste incineration activities.Many states in USA now prohibit the landfilling ofhousehold batteries.Automobiles use lead-acid batteries, each of whichcontains about 18 lbs of lead and a gallon of sulfuric25acid, both hazardous materials.» Used Oil:The principal source of used oil is fromthe servicing of automobiles and othermoving vehicles.Waste oil placed in the same containers asother solid waste components tends tocontaminate them and thus reduces theirvalue as recycled materials.26» RubberTires:It was reported that in last decade, about230-240 million rubber tires were disposedof annually in landfills or kept instockpiles in USA.Because tires do not compact well, theirdisposal in landfills is expensive andwasteful of space.Stockpiling of tires also poses seriousenvironmental problems, e.g., large anddifficult to extinguish fires.27(d) Hazardous Wastes•Wastes or combinations of wastes that pose substantialpresent or potential hazard to human health or other livingorganisms have been defined as hazardous wastes.(ii) Institutional Wastes•Institutional sources of solid wastes include:» Government centers» Schools» Prisons» Hospitals28• Excluding manufacturing wastes from prisons and medicalwastes from hospitals, the solid wastes generated at abovementioned sources are quite similar to commingled MSW.(iii) Construction and Demolition Wastes• Wastes from construction, remodeling, and repairing ofindividual residences and commercial buildings, and otherstructures are classified as construction wastes.• The composition is variable and may include:»»»»»»»»dirtstonesconcretebricksplasterlumber and plumbingheatingelectrical parts29• Wastes from razed buildings, broken-out streets, sidewalks,bridges, and other structures are classified as demolitionwastes.• The composition of demolition wastes is similar toconstruction wastes, but may include broken glass, plastics,and reinforced steel.30(iv) Municipal Services Wastes• Community wastes resulting from the operation andmaintenance of municipal facilities and the provision ofmunicipal services, include:· street sweepings· road side litter· landscape and tree trimmings· dead animals· abandoned automobiles, etc.31(v) Treatment Plant Wastes and Other Residues• The solid and semisolid wastes from water, wastewater, andindustrial waste treatment facilities are termed treatmentplant wastes.• The specific characteristics of such wastes vary, dependingon the nature of the treatment process.• Materials remaining from the combustion of wood, coal,coke, and other combustible wastes are categorized asashes and residues.• These residues are normally composed of fine, powderymaterials, cinders, clinkers, and small amounts of burned32and partially burned materials.• Glass, crockery, and various metals are also found in theresidues from municipal incinerators.(vi) Industrial Solid Waste Excluding ProcessWastes• Sources and types of solid waste generated at industrial sitesare grouped according to their Standard Industrialclassification (SIC).• SIC list excludes industrial process wastes and anyhazardous wastes that may be generated at industrialfacilities.33(vii) Agricultural Wastes• Wastes and residues resulting from diverse agriculturalactivities are collectively called agricultural wastes, andinclude wastes generate from:·planting and harvesting of crops·the production of milk·the production of animals for slaughter·the operations of feedlots34• At present, the disposal of these wastes is not theresponsibility of municipalities.• However, the disposal of animal manures has become acritical problem, especially from feedlots and dairies.352.3 Composition of MSW• The total solid wastes from a typical community in UnitedStates are composed of the waste materials identified inTable 2.4.• As noted in Table 2.4, the residential and commercialportion makes up about 50 to 75 percent of the total MSWgenerated in a community.• The actual percentage distribution will depend on:(1) the extent of the construction and demolition activities,(2) the extent of the municipal services provided, and(3) the types of water and wastewater treatment processesthat are used.36Table 2.4 Distribution of all Components of MSW Generated in a Typical Community in USAWaste

DemolitionMunicipal ServicesParks and recreational areasCatch basinTreatment Plant SludgesTotal100.0• The wide variation in the special wastes category (3 to 12percent) is due to the fact that in many communities yardwastes are collected separately.• The percentage of construction and demolition wastes varieswidely depending on the part of the country and the generalhealth of the local, state, and national economy.38Distribution of Individual Waste Components in USA• In order to formulate waste collection plans, not onlythe data on quantity (generation rates) but also thecharacteristics of the solid wastes is essential.• Information and data on the physical composition ofsolid wastes are important:» in the selection and operation of equipment andfacilities,» in assessing the feasibility of resource and energyrecovery, and» in the analysis and design of landfill disposalfacilities.39• To evaluate the waste composition and characteristics,mainly two approaches are practiced: physical and chemicalanalysis.• Physical parameters to be determined are:» refuse density (mass/volume, kg/m3)» moisture content (% water),» calorific value (Kcal/kg) ,» and other components (% mass faction)e.g. paper, glass, metal, plastics, textile, wood/grass,food waste, ash/soil» Combustibles (% mass faction)» Non-combustibles (% mass faction)40Residential Portion of MSW• Components that typically make up the residential portionof MSW in USA, excluding special and hazardous wastes,and their relative distribution are presented in Table 2.5.• Table 2.6 shows the average composition of residentialMSW as discarded in USA during 1970 – 2000.• Figure 2.1 shows the composition of MSW in USA in 2008.• The residential MSW (including waste from apartments andhouses) was estimated to be 55 to 65 percent of total MSWgeneration.• Waste from commercial and institutional locations, such asschools, hospitals, and businesses, amounted to 35 to 45percent.41Table 2.5 Typical physical

materials used for packaging is reported in Column 3of Table 2.5.• In 1990 packaging wastes was estimated to account forapproximately one-third of the residential and commercialMSW in USA at that time (20 years ago).• The values given in Table 2.5 for food waste, plastics, andyard wastes have considerably varied from the values givenin the corresponding table in the earlier published literature.46• The differences are largely due to(1) improved food processing techniques and the increaseduse of kitchen food waste grinders,(2) the increased use of plastics for food packaging andother packaging, and(3) the fact that burning of yard wastes is no longer allowedin most communities in USA.47Residential Portion of MSW in Other Countries• For the purposes of comparison, typical data on thedistribution of the components in residential MSW fromother countries are presented in Table 2.7.• In comparing the data presented in Tables 2.5 and 2.7, notethe high percentage of food waste in less-developedcountries.• The percentage of food wastes is high because mostvegetables and fruits are not pre-trimmed, there areessentially no kitchen food waste grinders, and the amountsof the other components are quite small.48Table 2.7 Typical distribution of components in residential MSW for low,middle, and upper-income countries excluding recycled

of wastes in developing countries are invariablylower than in the developed world due to:» lower general prosperity» lower level of consumption of the population, as well as» extensive scavenging and salvation of reusable materialbefore and during the waste collection and disposalsystem.• However, densities of waste in developing nations is muchhigher due to the less amount of paper, packaging material,plastic, and glass and hence a much greater concentration ofputtrescible matter.51• Tables 2.8 & 2.9 present an overall view of the solid wastecompositions in some Asian cities about 2 decades ago.• An overview of Table 2.8 suggests a wide variation in themunicipal solid waste composition among the various citiesof the Asian countries or even among different districts andincome groups of the same city.• However, certain trends are apparent as discussed here.• Municipal solid waste in these Asian countries are generallydense with the exception of newly industrialized nations.• The refuse density ranges from about 180 kg/m3 forSingapore and Japan to 400‑600 kg/m3 for lessindustrialized and poor countries.52Table 2.8 Composition of Municipal Solid Waste in

Organic waste consisting mainly of food waste andputtrescible material is the major component, particularly inSri Lanka and Malaysia.• The proportion of waste paper is on the lower side except inJapan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.• This clearly indicates higher packaging material in moreaffluent nations.• Metals, glass, plastics, textiles, and wood fractions of themunicipal waste in these Asian countries account for only a56small fraction of the total amount of solid wastes generated.• With an increase in the standard of living of a country,there is a trend towards a higher use of plastics.• Hong Kong's municipal waste has 20.1% of waste plastics,the highest among the Asian countries.• The waste metals are normally higher in the countries withhigher degree of industrialization.• Much of the metals in recoverable form is recycled andreused, and the metal content of the waste is essentially inthe form of non‑recoverable metal pieces, nails etc.• The common practice of including street sweepings in themunicipal solid waste increases the ash/soil, stone andother inert contents in the waste of India and China.57• The higher inert and ash content in turn is reflected in thecomparatively higher refuse densities.• The larger organic fraction, higher moisture content, andhigher inert contents give the waste a lower calorific value.582.4 Determination of the Composition of MSW inthe Field• Because of the heterogeneous nature of solid wastes,determination of the composition is not an easy task.• Strict statistical procedures are difficult, if not impossible,to implement.• For this reason, more generalized field procedures, based oncommon sense and random sampling techniques, haveevolved for determining composition.59Residential MSW• The procedure for residential MSW involves unloading andanalyzing a quantity of residential waste in a controlled areaof a disposal site that is isolated from winds and separatefrom other operations.• A representative residential sample might be a truckloadresulting from a typical weekday collection route in aresidential area.• A mixed sample from an incinerator storage pit or thedischarge pit of a shredder would also be representative.• Common sense is important in selecting the load to besampled.60• For example, a load containing the weekly accumulationof yard wastes (leaves) during autumn would not betypical.• To ensure that the results obtained are representative, alarge enough sample must be examined.• 1700 lb taken from the same waste load.• It has been found that measurements made on a samplesize of about 200 lb vary insignificantly frommeasurements made on samples of up to• To obtain a sample for analysis, the load is first quartered.61• One part is then selected for additional quartering until asample size of about 200 lb is obtained. It is important tomaintain the integrity of each selected quarter, regardless ofthe odor or physical decay, and to make sure that all thecomponents are measured.• Only in this way can some degree of randomness andunbiased selection be maintained.62Commercial and Industrial MSW• The field procedure for component identification forcommercial and non process industrial solid wastedinvolves the analysis of representative waste samples takendirectly from the source, not from a mixed waste load in acollection vehicle.• Because commercial and industrial sources are so variable,statistically valid sampling is seldom possible.• Estimation of the distribution of waste components andquantities for these activities remains an art form.63Table 2.10 Average Composition of Residential MSWas Discarded in USA during 1970 - 2008Percent by Weight (Dry Basis)Composition19701980199020002008Paper37.440.143.448.031.0Yard wastes13.912.912.311.913.2Food waste20.016.114.012.112.7Glass9.010.29.58.14.9Metals8.48.98.67.18.4Wood3.12.42.01.62.2Textiles2.22.32.73.13.9Leather & Rubber1.21.21.21.31.8Plastics1.43.03.94.712.0Miscellaneous3.42.72.42.13.364
