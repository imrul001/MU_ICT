(3.5), are presented in Fig.3.4.21Fig 3.1. Typical sizes of individual components comprisingresidential and commercial MSW22Fig. 3.2 Percentage of total mass of residential and commercial MSWas a function of mesh size23Fig. 3.3 Typical size distribution of the components found in residentialMSW24d1 = length, ld2 = width, wFig. 3.4 Typical distribution by count of effective sizes of aluminum cans, tincans, and glass containers found in residential MSW as delivered to alandfill.25Because there are significant differences among thevarious measures on size, individual measurements shouldbe made on the waste in question using a measure of sizethat will provide the information needed for the specificapplication.(iv) Field CapacityThe field capacity of solid waste is the total amount ofmoisture that can be retained in a waste sample subject tothe downward pull of gravity.The field capacity of waste materials is of criticalimportance in determining the formation of leachate inlandfills.26Water in excess of the field capacity will be released asleachate.The field capacity varies with the degree of applied pressureand the state of decomposition of the waste.The field capacity of uncompacted commingled wastes fromresidential and commercial sources is in the range of 50 to60 % .27(v) Permeability of Compacted WasteThe hydraulic conductivity of compacted wastes is animportant physical property that, to a large extent, governsthe movement of liquids and gases in a landfill and isrepresented by the term permeability.The coefficient of permeability is normally written as:K  Cdk2where KCdk(3.7)= coefficient of permeability= dimensionless constant or shape factor= average size of pores= specific weight of water= dynamic viscosity of water= intrinsic permeability28The term Cd² is known as the intrinsic (or specific)permeability.The intrinsic permeability depends solely on the propertiesof the solid material, including pore size distribution,tortuosity, specific surface, and porosity.Typical values for the intrinsic permeability for compactedsolid waste in a landfill are in the range between about 10-11and 10-12 m² in the vertical direction and about 10-10 m² inthe horizontal direction.293.2 Chemical Properties of MSWInformation on the chemical composition of thecomponents that constitute MSW is important inevaluation of alternative processing and recovery options.For example, the feasibility of combustion depends onthe chemical composition of the solid wastes.Typically, wastes can be thought of as a combination ofsemi moist combustible and noncombustible materials.30If solid wastes are to be used as fuel, the four mostimportant properties to be known are:-Proximate analysisFusing point of ashUltimate analysis (major elements)Energy contentWhere the organic fraction of MSW is to be composted oris to be used as feedstock for the production of otherbiological conversion products, not only will informationon the major elements (ultimate analysis) that composethe waste be important, but also information will berequired on the trace elements in the waste materials.31(i) Proximate AnalysisProximate analysis for the combustible components ofMSW includes the following tests: (typical data shownin Table 3.2)Moisture (loss of moisture when heated to 105oC for 1 h)Volatile combustible matter (additional loss of weight onignition at 950oC in a covered crucible)Fixed carbon (combustible residue left after volatile matter isremoved)Ash or non-combustibles (weight of residue after combustionin an open crucible)32Table 3.2 Typical proximate analysis and energy data for materials found in residential,commercial, and industrial solid wastesProximate analysis, % by weightEnergy content, Btu/lb.MoistureVolatilematterFixedcarbonNoncombustibleAscollectedDryDry ashfreeFats2.095.32.50.216,13516,46616,836Food wastes (mixed)70.021.43.65.01,7975,9837,180Fruit wastes78.716.64.00.71,7078,0138,285Meat wastes38.856.41.83.17,62312,45513,120Cardboard5.277.512.35.07,0427,4287,842Magazines4.166.47.022.55,2545,4787,157Newsprint6.081.111.51.47,9758,4848,612Paper (mixed)10.275.98.45.46,7997,5718,056Waxed cartons3.490.94.51.211,32611,72411,872Plastics (mixed)0.295.82.02.014,10114,39016,024Polyethylene0.298.5<0.11.218,68718,72418,952Polystyrene0.298.70.70.516,41916,45116,430Polyurethane0.287.18.34.411,20411,22611,74433Type of wasteFood and food productsPaper productsPlasticsTable 3.2 (contd.)

(3.10), the oxygen content is divided by eight andsubtracted from the hydrogen to account for the amount ofhydrogen that reacts with the oxygen that is present and,thus, does not contribute to the energy content of thewaste.The use of Eq.

The computed energy content of the waste is higherthan the value computed in Example 3.3 becauseonly the organic fraction of the residential MSWwas considered in Example 3.2.63Essential Nutrients and Other ElementsWhere the organic fraction of MSW is to be used as feedstock forthe production of biological conversion products such ascompost, methane, and ethanol, information on the essentialnutrients and elements in the waste materials is of importancewith respect to the microbial nutrient balance and in assessingwhat final uses can be made of the materials remaining afterbiological conversion.The essential nutrients and elements found in the principalmaterials that compose the organic fraction of MSW are reportedin Table 3.6.64Table 3.6 Elemental analysis of the organic materials used as thefeedstock for biological conversion processesFeed substrate (dry basis)ConstituentUnitNH4-NNO3-NPPO4-PKSO4-SCaMgNaBppmppmppmppm%ppm%%%ppmNewsprintOffice paperYard wasteFood waste4444200.351590.010.020.7414612182951640.293240.100.041.05281494903,5002,2102.278820.420.210.06882054,2784,9003,2004.188550.430.160.151765Table 3.6 (contd.)

(e.g., food wastes).Biodegradability of Organic Waste ComponentsVolatile solids (VS) content, determined by ignition at550oC, is often used as a measure of the biodegradabilityof the organic fraction of MSW.The use of VS in describing the biodegradability of theorganic fraction of MSW is misleading, as some of theorganic constituents of MSW are highly volatile but lowin biodegradability (e.g., newsprint and certain planttrimmings).69Alternatively, the lignin content of a waste can beused to estimate the biodegradable fraction, usingthe following relationship:BF = 0.83 – 0.028 LCWhere BF=0.830.028LC===(3.11)biological fraction expressed ona volatile solids (VS) basisempirical constantempirical constantlignin content of the VSexpressed as a percent of dryweight70The biodegradability of several of the organic compoundsfound in MSW, based on lignin content, is reported in Table3.7.As shown in Table 3.7, wastes with high lignin contents,such as newsprint, are significantly less biodegradable thanthe other organic wastes found in MSW.The rate at which the various components can be degradedvaries markedly.For practical purposes, the principal organic wastecomponents in MSW are often classified as rapidly andslowly decomposable.71Table 3.7 Data on the biodegradable fraction of selected organicwaste components based on lignin contentComponentFood wastePaperNewsprintOffice paperCardboardYard wastesVolatile solids(VS), Percent oftotal solid (TS)LigninContent (LC),Percent of VSBiodegradaFraction (BF)7-150.40.8294.096.494.050-9021.90.412.94.10.220.820.470.7272
