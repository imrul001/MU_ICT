2.1 Generation Rates
• Solid waste generation rate of a city or town is the estimated
amount of wastes, usually in kilograms per person per day
(kg/c/d = kg per capita per day).
• Nearly all the countries of the world are now facing the
problem of dealing with growing mountains of solid wastes,
especially in the big, bulging, and dynamic metropolitan
cities.
• The first and the very basic factor affecting the quantity of
wastes in a country is the population.
• Simply enough, more number of people will produce more
waste.
3

• Secondly, it is a well evident fact that the quantity of waste
generated in a country is directly related to the degree of
development of the country.
• Statistics show that the waste increases proportionally to the
GNP (Gross National Product – an economic indicator) of
the nation.
• The total annual amount of solid wastes produced in a
country depends on many factors e.g.:
» population of the country,
» standard of living,
» social and cultural traditions of the people,
» degree of industrialization
4

• The per capita quantity of waste serves a better parameter
for the comparative view among various countries.
• Municipal solid waste includes wastes generated in
residential and commercial areas and therefore becomes
the responsibility of the area municipal authority.
• Wastes from industrial and agricultural operations are
considered separately.
• However, it is government's duty to enforce proper laws
and regulations with regards to the industrial and other
kinds of waste management.
5

• In addition to the waste produced in residential and
commercial premises, street waste is also included in the
municipal solid wastes.
• Demolition and construction wastes are not normally
expected to be dumped in the municipal collection bins and
the concerned parties are required to bring the material
directly to specific disposal sites for its disposal.
• Industries produce different categories of wastes which
include those from processes, packaging, offices, canteen
and plant.
• Excluding the process solid waste, the remaining
categories can be and usually are disposed along with
municipal wastes.
6

• Industrial processes solid wastes which are not of toxic
nature, can be disposed at the common sites.
• Industrial establishments are responsible for the storage,
collection, and transportation to the disposal sites.
• Agricultural wastes are normally not considered within
municipal limits.
• However, similar types of wastes could be expected from
institutional gardens, nurseries and experimental farms
within municipal limits.
• The quantity of municipal solid wastes generated can be
assessed accurately in house to house collection system.
7

• Unfortunately, in most developing countries such system is
practiced only in selected parts of a few metropolitan cities
and therefore making it difficult to assess the quantity
correctly.
• Also, the quantity of waste measured at the disposal site
can not be relied upon as it does not represent the total
amount of waste generated.
• The per capita generation rates for some Asian countries
are given in Tables 2.1-2.2

Table 2.4 : The Amount of Municipal Solid Waste between 2003 - 2004

12

Example 2.1:
Based on the information reported by the Pollution
Control Department of Thailand (PCD) in Table 2.2:
(a) How much % increase was in solid waste generated in
the Bangkok Metropolitan Area (BMA) during the
period of 1992-1999?
(b) Assuming Thailand’s population in 1999 to be at 65
million, determine the per capita solid waste
generation rate for the whole country in that year.

13

Solution:
(a) Solid waste generation rate in BMA
region during 1992 (tons/day)
Total amount of wastes generated
during 1992 (tons)
Solid waste generation rate in BMA
region during 1999 (tons/day)
Total amount of wastes generated
during 1999 (tons)
Therefore, % increase in waste =
generation during 1992 - 1999
(8990 - 6000) x 365 x 100
6000 x 365

=

6,000

=

6,000 x 365

=

8,990

=

8,990 x 365

= 2990 x 100
6000
= 49.83 %
14

(b)

Solid waste generation rate in
Thailand during 1999

=

37,879 (tons/d)

Thailand’s population in 1999

=

65 x 106

So, per capita solid waste
generation rate for the whole
country in that year

=

37879 x 1000 kg/c/d
65 x 106

=

0.582 kg/c/d

2. 2 Waste Characterization
2.2.1 Sources of Solid Wastes
• In order to plan and design the various elements of
solid waste management activities, knowledge about
the sources and types (categories) of wastes as well
as information on the quantity and the composition
of wastes generated from each source is essential.
• Based on the commonly adapted source
classification, the following waste categories are
generally used:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

residential
commercial
institutional
construction and demolition

2.2.2 Classification of Solid Wastes
• The general classification and description of wastes
generated at each of the sources is presented as
follows:
(i) Residential and Commercial Wastes

• Solid wastes generated in the residential,
commercial, and institutional parts of a community
are grouped in two kinds:
(1) Organic Fraction of Wastes – (Combustibles)
(2) Inorganic Fraction of Wastes – ( Incombustibles)
20

(1) Organic Fraction of Wastes – (Combustibles)
• The organic fraction of residential and commercial
waste consists of materials such as:
» Food waste (also called garbage)
» Paper of all types
» Cardboard (also called paperboard and
corrugated paper)
» Plastics of all types
» Textiles
» Rubber
» Leather
» Wood and yard wastes

21

(2) Inorganic Fraction of Wastes – (Incombustibles)
• The inorganic fraction consists of items such as
» Glass
» Crockery
» tin cans
» Aluminum
» ferrous metals
» dirt

Terms Used for Some Categories of Municipal Solid
Wastes
(a) Commingled Municipal Solid Wastes
• If the waste components are not separated when discarded,
then the mixture of these wastes is also known as
commingled MSW.
22

(b) Putrescible Waste
• Wastes that will decompose rapidly, especially in warm
weather, are also known as putrescible waste.
• The principal source of putrescible wastes is the handling,
preparation, cooking, and eating of foods.
• Often, decomposition will lead to the development of
offensive odors and breeding of flies and other disease
vectors.
• Apart from the above mentioned categories of solid wastes
found in residential and commercial areas, there are two
more kinds of wastes generated at these sources:
(c) Special Wastes
(d) Hazardous Wastes

23

(c) Special Wastes
• Special wastes from residential and commercial sources
include:
» Bulky Items: large worn-out or broken household,
commercial, and industrial items such as
furniture, lamps, bookcases, filing
cabinets, and other similar items
» Consumer worn-out, broken and other no longer
Electronics:
wanted items such as radios, stereos,
and
television sets
» White
Goods:

large stoves, refrigerators, dishwaters,
and clothes washers and dryers.

Collected separately, white goods are
usually dismantled for the recovery of
specific materials (e.g. aluminum, etc.)

24

» Used
The principal sources of batteries are
Batteries:
from households and automobiles and
other vehicle serving facilities.
Household batteries come in a variety of types,
including alkaline, mercury, silver, zinc, nickel, and
cadmium.
The metals found in discarded batteries found in MSW
can cause groundwater contamination through leachate
from landfills.
They can also be found in air emissions and ash from
waste incineration activities.
Many states in USA now prohibit the landfilling of
household batteries.
Automobiles use lead-acid batteries, each of which
contains about 18 lbs of lead and a gallon of sulfuric25
acid, both hazardous materials.

» Used Oil:

The principal source of used oil is from
the servicing of automobiles and other
moving vehicles.
Waste oil placed in the same containers as
other solid waste components tends to
contaminate them and thus reduces their
value as recycled materials.

26

» Rubber
Tires:

It was reported that in last decade, about
230-240 million rubber tires were disposed
of annually in landfills or kept in
stockpiles in USA.
Because tires do not compact well, their
disposal in landfills is expensive and
wasteful of space.
Stockpiling of tires also poses serious
environmental problems, e.g., large and
difficult to extinguish fires.

27

(d) Hazardous Wastes
•

Wastes or combinations of wastes that pose substantial
present or potential hazard to human health or other living
organisms have been defined as hazardous wastes.

(ii) Institutional Wastes
•

Institutional sources of solid wastes include:
» Government centers
» Schools
» Prisons
» Hospitals
28

• Excluding manufacturing wastes from prisons and medical
wastes from hospitals, the solid wastes generated at above
mentioned sources are quite similar to commingled MSW.

(iii) Construction and Demolition Wastes
• Wastes from construction, remodeling, and repairing of
individual residences and commercial buildings, and other
structures are classified as construction wastes.
• The composition is variable and may include:
»
»
»
»
»
»
»
»

dirt
stones
concrete
bricks
plaster
lumber and plumbing
heating
electrical parts

29

• Wastes from razed buildings, broken-out streets, sidewalks,
bridges, and other structures are classified as demolition
wastes.
• The composition of demolition wastes is similar to
construction wastes, but may include broken glass, plastics,
and reinforced steel.

30

(iv) Municipal Services Wastes
• Community wastes resulting from the operation and
maintenance of municipal facilities and the provision of
municipal services, include:
· street sweepings
· road side litter
· landscape and tree trimmings
· dead animals
· abandoned automobiles, etc.

31

(v) Treatment Plant Wastes and Other Residues
• The solid and semisolid wastes from water, wastewater, and
industrial waste treatment facilities are termed treatment
plant wastes.
• The specific characteristics of such wastes vary, depending
on the nature of the treatment process.
• Materials remaining from the combustion of wood, coal,
coke, and other combustible wastes are categorized as
ashes and residues.
• These residues are normally composed of fine, powdery
materials, cinders, clinkers, and small amounts of burned
32
and partially burned materials.

• Glass, crockery, and various metals are also found in the
residues from municipal incinerators.

(vi) Industrial Solid Waste Excluding Process
Wastes
• Sources and types of solid waste generated at industrial sites
are grouped according to their Standard Industrial
classification (SIC).
• SIC list excludes industrial process wastes and any
hazardous wastes that may be generated at industrial
facilities.

33

(vii) Agricultural Wastes
• Wastes and residues resulting from diverse agricultural
activities are collectively called agricultural wastes, and
include wastes generate from:
·

planting and harvesting of crops

·

the production of milk

·

the production of animals for slaughter

·

the operations of feedlots

34

• At present, the disposal of these wastes is not the
responsibility of municipalities.
• However, the disposal of animal manures has become a
critical problem, especially from feedlots and dairies.

35

2.3 Composition of MSW
• The total solid wastes from a typical community in United
States are composed of the waste materials identified in
Table 2.4.
• As noted in Table 2.4, the residential and commercial
portion makes up about 50 to 75 percent of the total MSW
generated in a community.
• The actual percentage distribution will depend on:
(1) the extent of the construction and demolition activities,
(2) the extent of the municipal services provided, and
(3) the types of water and wastewater treatment processes
that are used.

• The wide variation in the special wastes category (3 to 12
percent) is due to the fact that in many communities yard
wastes are collected separately.
• The percentage of construction and demolition wastes varies
widely depending on the part of the country and the general
health of the local, state, and national economy.

38

Distribution of Individual Waste Components in USA
• In order to formulate waste collection plans, not only
the data on quantity (generation rates) but also the
characteristics of the solid wastes is essential.
• Information and data on the physical composition of
solid wastes are important:
» in the selection and operation of equipment and
facilities,
» in assessing the feasibility of resource and energy
recovery, and
» in the analysis and design of landfill disposal
facilities.
39

• To evaluate the waste composition and characteristics,
mainly two approaches are practiced: physical and chemical
analysis.
• Physical parameters to be determined are:
» refuse density (mass/volume, kg/m3)
» moisture content (% water),
» calorific value (Kcal/kg) ,
» and other components (% mass faction)
e.g. paper, glass, metal, plastics, textile, wood/grass,
food waste, ash/soil
» Combustibles (% mass faction)
» Non-combustibles (% mass faction)
40

Residential Portion of MSW
• Components that typically make up the residential portion
of MSW in USA, excluding special and hazardous wastes,
and their relative distribution are presented in Table 2.5.
• Table 2.6 shows the average composition of residential
MSW as discarded in USA during 1970 – 2000.
• Figure 2.1 shows the composition of MSW in USA in 2008.
• The residential MSW (including waste from apartments and
houses) was estimated to be 55 to 65 percent of total MSW
generation.
• Waste from commercial and institutional locations, such as
schools, hospitals, and businesses, amounted to 35 to 45
percent.

Distribution of Waste Components
• For the purpose of comparison, the percentage distribution
of the materials used for packaging is reported in Column 3
of Table 2.5.
• In 1990 packaging wastes was estimated to account for
approximately one-third of the residential and commercial
MSW in USA at that time (20 years ago).
• The values given in Table 2.5 for food waste, plastics, and
yard wastes have considerably varied from the values given
in the corresponding table in the earlier published literature.

46

• The differences are largely due to
(1) improved food processing techniques and the increased
use of kitchen food waste grinders,
(2) the increased use of plastics for food packaging and
other packaging, and
(3) the fact that burning of yard wastes is no longer allowed
in most communities in USA.

47

Residential Portion of MSW in Other Countries
• For the purposes of comparison, typical data on the
distribution of the components in residential MSW from
other countries are presented in Table 2.7.
• In comparing the data presented in Tables 2.5 and 2.7, note
the high percentage of food waste in less-developed
countries.
• The percentage of food wastes is high because most
vegetables and fruits are not pre-trimmed, there are
essentially no kitchen food waste grinders, and the amounts
of the other components are quite small.

• Quantities of wastes in developing countries are invariably
lower than in the developed world due to:
» lower general prosperity
» lower level of consumption of the population, as well as
» extensive scavenging and salvation of reusable material
before and during the waste collection and disposal
system.

• However, densities of waste in developing nations is much
higher due to the less amount of paper, packaging material,
plastic, and glass and hence a much greater concentration of

• Tables 2.8 & 2.9 present an overall view of the solid waste
compositions in some Asian cities about 2 decades ago.
• An overview of Table 2.8 suggests a wide variation in the
municipal solid waste composition among the various cities
of the Asian countries or even among different districts and
income groups of the same city.
• However, certain trends are apparent as discussed here.
• Municipal solid waste in these Asian countries are generally
dense with the exception of newly industrialized nations.
• The refuse density ranges from about 180 kg/m3 for
Singapore and Japan to 400‑600 kg/m3 for less
industrialized and poor countries.

• The waste from these countries contain a larger amount of
organic fraction and lesser amount of paper, glass, metals,
and plastics.
• Organic waste consisting mainly of food waste and
puttrescible material is the major component, particularly in
Sri Lanka and Malaysia.
• The proportion of waste paper is on the lower side except in
Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.
• This clearly indicates higher packaging material in more
affluent nations.
• Metals, glass, plastics, textiles, and wood fractions of the
municipal waste in these Asian countries account for only a
56
small fraction of the total amount of solid wastes generated.

• With an increase in the standard of living of a country,
there is a trend towards a higher use of plastics.
• Hong Kong's municipal waste has 20.1% of waste plastics,
the highest among the Asian countries.
• The waste metals are normally higher in the countries with
higher degree of industrialization.
• Much of the metals in recoverable form is recycled and
reused, and the metal content of the waste is essentially in
the form of non‑recoverable metal pieces, nails etc.
• The common practice of including street sweepings in the
municipal solid waste increases the ash/soil, stone and
other inert contents in the waste of India and China.
57

• The higher inert and ash content in turn is reflected in the
comparatively higher refuse densities.
• The larger organic fraction, higher moisture content, and
higher inert contents give the waste a lower calorific value.

58

2.4 Determination of the Composition of MSW in
the Field
• Because of the heterogeneous nature of solid wastes,
determination of the composition is not an easy task.
• Strict statistical procedures are difficult, if not impossible,
to implement.
• For this reason, more generalized field procedures, based on
common sense and random sampling techniques, have
evolved for determining composition.

59

Residential MSW
• The procedure for residential MSW involves unloading and
analyzing a quantity of residential waste in a controlled area
of a disposal site that is isolated from winds and separate
from other operations.
• A representative residential sample might be a truckload
resulting from a typical weekday collection route in a
residential area.
• A mixed sample from an incinerator storage pit or the
discharge pit of a shredder would also be representative.
• Common sense is important in selecting the load to be
sampled.
60

• For example, a load containing the weekly accumulation
of yard wastes (leaves) during autumn would not be
typical.
• To ensure that the results obtained are representative, a
large enough sample must be examined.
• 1700 lb taken from the same waste load.
• It has been found that measurements made on a sample
size of about 200 lb vary insignificantly from
measurements made on samples of up to
• To obtain a sample for analysis, the load is first quartered.
61

• One part is then selected for additional quartering until a
sample size of about 200 lb is obtained. It is important to
maintain the integrity of each selected quarter, regardless of
the odor or physical decay, and to make sure that all the
components are measured.
• Only in this way can some degree of randomness and
unbiased selection be maintained.

62

Commercial and Industrial MSW
• The field procedure for component identification for
commercial and non process industrial solid wasted
involves the analysis of representative waste samples taken
directly from the source, not from a mixed waste load in a
collection vehicle.
• Because commercial and industrial sources are so variable,
statistically valid sampling is seldom possible.
• Estimation of the distribution of waste components and
quantities for these activities remains an art form.
