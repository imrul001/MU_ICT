Physical, Chemical, and Biological Properties
of Solid Waste
Waste characteristics and the transformations that they
undergo from the time of generation until final disposal and
thereafter, are very important to be known for planning the
various functional elements of waste management.
Information about the quantity and the physical, chemical,
and biological properties of municipal solid wastes (MSW)
is essential for designing the storage, collection,
transportation, recycling, treatment, and final disposal.

3.1 Physical Properties of Municipal Solid
Waste (MSW)
Important physical characteristics of MSW include:
specific weight
moisture content
particle size and size distribution
field capacity
compacted waste porosity

(i) Specific Weight
Specific weight is defined as the weight of a material
per unit volume (e.g., lb/ft3, lb/yd3, or kg/m3).
The specific weight of MSW is often reported as:





loose
as found in containers
uncompacted
compacted etc.

Therefore, the basis used for the reported values should
always be noted.
5

Specific weight data are often needed to estimate the
total mass and volume of waste that must be managed.
Unfortunately, there is little or no uniformity in the
way solid waste specific weights have been reported
in literature.
Frequently, no distinction has been made between
uncompacted or compacted specific weight.
Typical specific weights for various categories of
wastes in USA as found in containers, compacted or
uncompacted are reported in Table 3.1.

Because the specific weights of solid wastes vary
markedly with




geographic location,
season of the year, and
length of time in storage,

great care should be taken in selecting typical values.

11

(ii) Moisture Content
The moisture content of solid wastes is usually expressed
in one of the two ways:
(a) wet-weight basis
(b) dry-weight basis
In wet-weight method of measurement, the moisture in a
waste sample is expressed as a percentage of the wet
weight of the material.
In the dry-weight method, it is expressed as a percentage
of the dry weight of the material.
12

In solid wastes management field, the most commonly
used method is the wet-weight basis.
In equation form, the wet-weight basis moisture content of
any material is expressed as :
w d
M 
 x100
 w 

where,

M
w

=
=

d

=

(3.1)

moisture content, %
initial weight of sample as delivered, lb or
kg
weight of sample after drying at 105oC, lb
or kg

13

The use of data in Table 3.1 to estimate the overall moisture
content of solid wastes is illustrated in Example 3.1.
EXAMPLE 3.1 Estimation of moisture content of typical
residential MSW in USA

(iii) Particle Size and Size Distribution
The size and size distribution of the component materials
in solid wastes are an important consideration in the
recovery of materials, especially with mechanical means
such as trommel screens and magnetic separators.
The size of a waste component may be defined by one or
more of the following equations:

19

Sc  l

(3.2)

Sc

lw


 2 

(3.3)

Sc

lw h


3



(3.4)

S c  (l w )1 / 2

S c  (l w h )

(3.5)
1/ 3

(3.6)

where Sc = size of component, (in or mm)
l = length, (in or mm)
w = width, (in or mm)
h = height, (in or mm)

20

A general indication of the particle size distribution (by
longest dimension and ability to pass a sieve) may be
obtained from the data presented in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2.
Based on single linear measurement as defined by Eq.
(3.2), typical data on the size distribution of the individual
components in MSW are presented in Fig. 3.3.
The average size of the individual components found in
residential MSW is between 7 and 8 in.
Typical data on the size distribution of aluminum cans, tin
cans, and glass, based on Eq. (3.5), are presented in Fig.
3.4.

d2 = width, w

cans, and glass containers found in residential MSW as delivered to a
landfill.
25

Because there are significant differences among the
various measures on size, individual measurements should
be made on the waste in question using a measure of size
that will provide the information needed for the specific
application.
(iv) Field Capacity
The field capacity of solid waste is the total amount of
moisture that can be retained in a waste sample subject to
the downward pull of gravity.
The field capacity of waste materials is of critical
importance in determining the formation of leachate in
landfills.
26

Water in excess of the field capacity will be released as
leachate.
The field capacity varies with the degree of applied pressure
and the state of decomposition of the waste.
The field capacity of uncompacted commingled wastes from
residential and commercial sources is in the range of 50 to
60 % .

27

(v) Permeability of Compacted Waste
The hydraulic conductivity of compacted wastes is an
important physical property that, to a large extent, governs
the movement of liquids and gases in a landfill and is
represented by the term permeability.
The coefficient of permeability is normally written as:


K  Cd
k


2

where K
C
d


k

(3.7)

= coefficient of permeability
= dimensionless constant or shape factor
= average size of pores
= specific weight of water
= dynamic viscosity of water
= intrinsic permeability
28

The term Cd² is known as the intrinsic (or specific)
permeability.
The intrinsic permeability depends solely on the properties
of the solid material, including pore size distribution,
tortuosity, specific surface, and porosity.
Typical values for the intrinsic permeability for compacted
solid waste in a landfill are in the range between about 10-11
and 10-12 m² in the vertical direction and about 10-10 m² in
the horizontal direction.

29

3.2 Chemical Properties of MSW
Information on the chemical composition of the
components that constitute MSW is important in
evaluation of alternative processing and recovery options.
For example, the feasibility of combustion depends on
the chemical composition of the solid wastes.
Typically, wastes can be thought of as a combination of
semi moist combustible and noncombustible materials.

30

If solid wastes are to be used as fuel, the four most
important properties to be known are:
-

Proximate analysis
Fusing point of ash
Ultimate analysis (major elements)
Energy content

Where the organic fraction of MSW is to be composted or
is to be used as feedstock for the production of other
biological conversion products, not only will information
on the major elements (ultimate analysis) that compose
the waste be important, but also information will be
required on the trace elements in the waste materials.
31

(i) Proximate Analysis
Proximate analysis for the combustible components of
MSW includes the following tests: (typical data shown
in Table 3.2)
Moisture (loss of moisture when heated to 105oC for 1 h)
Volatile combustible matter (additional loss of weight on
ignition at 950oC in a covered crucible)
Fixed carbon (combustible residue left after volatile matter is
removed)
Ash or non-combustibles (weight of residue after combustion
in an open crucible)

(ii) Fusing Point of Ash
The fusing point of ash is defined as the temperature at
which the ash resulting from the burning of waste will form
a solid (clinker) by fusion and agglomeration.
Typical fusing temperatures for the formation of clinker
from solid waste range from 2000 to 2200F (1100 to
1200C).

36

(iii) Ultimate Analysis of Solid Waste Components
The ultimate analysis of a waste component typically
involves the determination of the percent C (carbon), H
(hydrogen), O (oxygen), N (nitrogen), S (sulfur), and ash.
Because of the concern over the emission of chlorinated
compounds during combustion, the determination of
halogens is also often included in an ultimate analysis.
The results of the ultimate analysis are used to characterize
the chemical composition of the organic matter in MSW.

37

They are also used to define the proper mix of waste
materials to achieve suitable C/N ratios for biological
conversion processes.
Data on the ultimate analysis of individual combustible
materials are presented in Table 3.3.

contained in the waste.
1 mole of H2O = 2 +16 = 18 lb wt.
18 lb of H2O has = 2 lb of H2
= 16 lb of O
21.4 l lb of H2O has = (2/18) x 21.4 = 2.38 lb of H2
So, wt of H2 in waste sample = 3.62 + 2.38 = 6.0 lb
21.4 l lb of H2O has = (16/18) x 21.4 = 19.02 lb of O
So, wt of O in waste sample = 22.97+ 19.02 = 41.99 lb

(iv) Energy Content of Solid Waste Components
The energy content of the organic components in MSW can
be determined
(1) by using a full scale boiler as a calorimeter,
(2) by using a laboratory bomb calorimeter, and
(3) by calculation, if the elemental composition is known.

Because of the difficulty in instrumentation on a full-scale
boiler, most of the data on the energy content of the organic
components of MSW are based on the results of bomb
calorimeter tests.

50

Typical data for energy content and inert residue for the
components of residential wastes are reported in Table
3.5.
As shown, the energy content values are on an as
discarded basis.
The Btu values given in Table 3.5 may be converted to a
dry basis by using Eq. (3.8).

In Eq. (3.10), the oxygen content is divided by eight and
subtracted from the hydrogen to account for the amount of
hydrogen that reacts with the oxygen that is present and,
thus, does not contribute to the energy content of the
waste.
The use of Eq. (3.10) is illustrated in Example 3.4.

Comment. The computed energy content of the waste is higher
than the value computed in Example 3.3 because
only the organic fraction of the residential MSW

Essential Nutrients and Other Elements
Where the organic fraction of MSW is to be used as feedstock for
the production of biological conversion products such as
compost, methane, and ethanol, information on the essential
nutrients and elements in the waste materials is of importance
with respect to the microbial nutrient balance and in assessing
what final uses can be made of the materials remaining after
biological conversion.
The essential nutrients and elements found in the principal
materials that compose the organic fraction of MSW are reported
in Table 3.6.

3.3 Biological Properties of MSW
Excluding plastic, rubber, and leather components, the
organic fraction of most MSW can be classified as
follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Water-soluble constituents, such as sugars, starches,
amino acids, and various organic acids,
Hemicellulose, a condensation product of five-and sixcarbon sugars,
Cellulose, a condensation product of the six-carbon
sugar glucose,
Fats, oils, and waxes, which are esters of alcohols and
long-chain fatty acids,

67

5.

6.
7.

Lignin, a polymeric material containing aromatic rings with
methoxyl groups (-OCH3), the exact chemical nature of which is
still not known (present in some paper products such as newsprint
and fiberboard),
Lignocellulose, a combination of lignin and cellulose,
Proteins, which are composed of chains of amino acids.

Perhaps the most important biological characteristic of the
organic fraction of MSW is that almost all of the organic
components can be converted biologically to gases and
relatively inert organic and inorganic solids.

68

The production of odors and the generation of flies are
also related to the putrescible nature of the organic
materials found in MSW. (e.g., food wastes).
Biodegradability of Organic Waste Components
Volatile solids (VS) content, determined by ignition at
550oC, is often used as a measure of the biodegradability
of the organic fraction of MSW.
The use of VS in describing the biodegradability of the
organic fraction of MSW is misleading, as some of the
organic constituents of MSW are highly volatile but low
in biodegradability (e.g., newsprint and certain plant
trimmings).
69

Alternatively, the lignin content of a waste can be
used to estimate the biodegradable fraction, using
the following relationship:
BF = 0.83 – 0.028 LC
Where BF

=

0.83
0.028
LC

=
=
=

(3.11)

biological fraction expressed on
a volatile solids (VS) basis
empirical constant
empirical constant
lignin content of the VS
expressed as a percent of dry
weight

70

The biodegradability of several of the organic compounds
found in MSW, based on lignin content, is reported in Table
3.7.
As shown in Table 3.7, wastes with high lignin contents,
such as newsprint, are significantly less biodegradable than
the other organic wastes found in MSW.
The rate at which the various components can be degraded
varies markedly.
For practical purposes, the principal organic waste
components in MSW are often classified as rapidly and
slowly decomposable.
