7.1 Disposal of Solid Wastes and Residual
Matter
• Enormous amounts of solid wastes are being produced by:
» the ever growing populations

coupled (together) with:
» raised living standards,
» rapid modernization, and
» complex industrial activities, etc.,

in every country of the world.
• The very big question faced by each local or central
government, at present, is: what to do with so much waste?
or how to manage the solid wastes in a proper way?
3

• Even after extensive scavenging of useful materials, very
huge quantities of solid wastes remain to be disposed of in
every city in every country of the world.
• Solid waste residues are waste materials:
» that are not recycled,
» that remain after processing at a materials recovery
facility, or
» that remain after the recovery of conversion products
and/or energy e.g. incineration process ashes.

• Historically, solid wastes have been placed in the soil in the
earth’s crust (land disposal) or deposited in the oceans.

4

• Unfortunately, despite some awareness of the problems
associated with improper solid waste disposal, general
public in many poor and developing countries around the
world including in Asia, is still unmindful of its crude
ways of disposing the wastes.
• Large amounts of solid wastes are still carelessly dumped
on land or in waterways causing severe environmental and
public health hazards.
• The safe and reliable long-term disposal of solid waste
residues is an important component of integrated waste
management.
• Land disposal of solid waste residues include:
» open dumping,
» controlled tipping, and
» sanitary landfilling.

7.2 Land Disposal of Solid Wastes
i) Open Dumping
•

The most common method of disposing solid wastes in
Asian region is by crude open dumping.

•

The disposal sites rarely meet the hygienic,
environmental, and public health requirements.

•

In most cases, final disposal of wastes receives very little
attention.

•

This situation predominantly is due to the lack of
awareness, enough resources and suitable technology.

•

With the exceptions of a few countries like Japan,
Singapore etc., all Asian countries practice open dumping
6
for municipal solid waste disposal.

ii) Controlled Tipping
•

If the land disposal is practiced at regularly managed sites,
using earth moving equipment to spread wastes and place
daily cover, it can be termed as "controlled tipping".
iii) Sanitary Landfilling

•

Sanitary landfilling, in the true sense, is the land disposal
similar to controlled tipping with additional
environmental protection measures, e.g.
» hydrogeologically secured sites,
» leachet control for ground water safety, and
» surface water protection, etc.

7

• The major countries that practice landfill disposal for
solid wastes, are United Kingdom, Canada, Germany,
United States, France and Japan.
• The United Kingdom ranks highest, burying about 90
percent of its solid waste in landfills.
• The United States ranks in the middle of the major
countries practicing landfill disposal.

7.3 The Landfill Method of Solid Waste
Disposal
• Even with implementation of waste reduction, recycling,
and transformation technologies, disposal of residual
solid waste still remains an important component of an
integrated solid waste management strategy.
• Historically, landfills have been the most economical and
environmentally acceptable method for the disposal of
solid wastes throughout the world.

What is a Landfill?
• There are two ways to bury trash:
Dump or Open Dump: an open hole in the ground where
trash is buried and that has various
animals (rats, mice, birds) around.
• This is most people's idea of a landfill!

9

• However, it is not landfilling but just open
dumping.
Landfill: carefully designed structure built into or
on top of the ground in which trash is
isolated from the surrounding
environment (groundwater, air, rain).
• A dump implies simply leaving solid wastes in a
localized area, with no caring for the final
condition of the dumped materials.
• A landfill is called “sanitary landfill”, if it is the
type that protects the surrounding soil, air and
water from pollution caused by the waste in the
10
landfill.

• This is accomplished via a number of techniques, including
underlying the solid wastes with clay (or any other type of
liner) and daily covering the waste with soil.
• The isolation of waste is accomplished with a bottom liner
and daily covering of soil.
• The purpose of a landfill is to bury the trash in such a way
that it will be isolated from groundwater, will be kept dry
and will not be in contact with air.
• Under these conditions, trash will not decompose much.
• A landfill is not like a compost pile, where the purpose is
to bury trash in such a way that it will decompose quickly.
11

7.3.1 The Landfilling Process
Definition of Terms
Landfills

- are the physical facilities used for the
disposal of residual solid wastes in the
surface soils of the earth.

• In the past, the term sanitary landfill was used to denote a
landfill in which the waste placed in the landfill and was
covered at the end of each day’s operation.
Sanitary Landfill - now refers to an engineered facility
for the disposal of MSW designed
and operated to minimize public
health and environmental impacts
(Figure7.1).

12

Figure 7.1 Sanitary Landfill
13

•

Sanitary landfills are sites where waste is isolated from
the environment until it is safe.

•

The waste is considered safe when it has completely
degraded biologically, chemically and physically.

•

–

Sanitary Landfill - landfill that uses a clay or any
synthetic material liner to isolate the trash from the
environment.

–

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Landfill - uses a
synthetic (plastic) liner to isolate the trash from the
environment.

Landfill management incorporates the planning, design,
operation, closure, and post-closure control of landfills.
14

Landfilling
•

It is the process by which residual solid is placed in a
landfill.
Sanitary Landfilling

•

Process of sanitary landfilling includes: (Figure 7.2)
» monitoring of the incoming waste stream,
» placement and compaction of the waste, and
» installation of landfill environmental monitoring
and control facilities.

•

Secure Landfills - landfills for the disposal of hazardous
wastes are called secure landfills. 15

Figure 7.2 . This cross-section drawing shows the structure of a
municipal solid waste landfill. The arrows indicate the
flow of leachate.

16

• The basic parts of a landfill, as shown in Figure 7.2, are:
– Bottom liner system - separates trash and subsequent leachate
(liquids flow from wastes) from
groundwater (B, C and E in Fig 7.2)
– Cells (old and new) - where the trash is stored within the landfill
(I and J in Fig. 7.2)
– Daily cover once the cell is made, it is covered with
six inches of soil and compacted (H in Fig)
– Storm water drainage system - collects rain water that falls on
the landfill (G in Fig)
– Leachate collection system - collects water that has percolated
through the landfill itself and
contains contaminating
substances (leachate) (D in Fig)
– Methane collection system - collects methane gas that is formed
during the breakdown of trash
17
– Covering or cap - seals off the top of the landfill

• Each of these parts is designed to address specific problems
that are encountered in a landfill.
• So, as we discuss each part of the landfill, we'll explain
what problem is solved.
(i) Bottom Liner System
• A landfill's major purpose and one of its biggest challenges
is to contain the trash so that the trash doesn't cause
problems in the environment.
• The bottom liner prevents the trash from coming in contact
with the outside soil, particularly the groundwater.
• Landfill liners are materials (both natural and
manufactured) that are used to line the bottom area and
below-grade sides of a landfill.

18

• Liners usually consist of layers of compacted clay and/or
geomembrane material designed to prevent migration of
landfill leachate and landfill gas.
• In MSW landfills, the liner is usually some type of durable,
puncture-resistant synthetic plastic (polyethylene, highdensity polyethylene, polyvinylchloride -PVC).
• It is usually 30-100 mm thick.
• The plastic liner may also be combined with compacted
clay soils as an additional liner.
• Optionally, the plastic liner may be surrounded on either
side by a fabric mat (geotextile mat) that will help to keep
the plastic liner from tearing or puncturing from the nearby
rock and gravel layers.
19

(ii) Cells (Old and New)
• Perhaps, the most precious commodity and overriding
problem in a landfill is air space.
• The amount of space is directly related to the capacity and
usable life of the landfill.
• If you can decrease the air space, then you can extend the
usable life of the landfill.
• To do this, trash is compacted into areas, called cells, that
contain only one day's trash.
• Cell - the term cell is used to describe the volume of
material placed in a landfill during one operating period,
usually one day.

20

• The amount of trash within the cell is compressed by
heavy equipment (tractors, bulldozers, rollers and
graders) that go over the mound of trash several times)
(Figure 7.3).
(iii) Daily cover
• A cell includes the solid waste deposited and the daily
cover material surrounding it.
• Once the cell is made, it is covered with six inches of soil
and compacted further.
• In addition to compressing the trash into cells, space is
conserved by excluding bulky materials, such as carpets,
mattresses, foam and yard waste, from the landfill.
21

Figure 7.3 A bulldozer prepares a new cell in a landfill
22

•

Daily cover usually consists of 6 to 12 “ (15 to 30 cm) of
native soil or alternative materials such as compost that
are applied to the working faces of the landfill at the end
of each operating period.

•

The purposes of daily cover are:
» to control the blowing of waste materials;
» to prevent rats, flies, and other disease vectors from
entering or exiting the landfill; and
» to control the entry of water into the landfill during
operation.

•

Cells are arranged in rows and layers of adjoining cells
(lifts).

•

A lift is a complete layer of cells over the active area of
the landfill (Figure 7.4).
23

Figure 7.4 Schematics of Sanitary Landfill

24

•

Typically, landfills are comprised of a series of lifts.

•

A bench (or terrace) is commonly used where the height
of the landfill will exceed 50 to 75 ft (15 to 22.5 m).

•

Benches are used:
» to maintain the slope stability of the landfill,
» for the placement of surface water drainage channels,
and
» for the location of landfill gas recovery piping.

25

(iv) Storm Water Drainage
• It is important to keep the landfill as dry as possible to
reduce the amount of leachate.
• This can be done in two ways:
(1) Excluding Liquids from the Solid Waste.
• Solid waste must be tested for liquids before entering the
landfill.
• This is done by passing samples of the waste through
standard paint filters.
• If no liquid comes through the sample after 10 minutes,
then the trash is accepted into the landfill.
26

(2) Keeping Rainwater Out of the Landfill
• To exclude rainwater, the landfill has a storm drainage
system.
• Plastic drainage pipes and storm liners collect water from
areas of the landfill and channel it to drainage ditches
surrounding the landfill's base (Figure 7.5).
• The ditches are either concrete or gravel-lined and carry
water to collection ponds to the side of the landfill (Figure
7.6).
• In the collection ponds, suspended soil particles are allowed
to settle and the water is tested for leachate chemicals
(Figure 7.7).
• Once settling has occurred and the water has passed tests, it
is then pumped or allowed to flow off-site.
27

The black pipe carries landfill gas to a pumping station.

29

Figure 7.7 This collection pond is for catching storm water. The black
liner helps channel the water and protect the underlying cells
30

(v) Leachate Collection System
• No system to exclude water from the landfill is perfect
and water does get into the landfill.
• The water percolates through the cells and soil in the
landfill much as water percolates through ground coffee
in a drip coffee maker.
• As the water percolates through the trash, it picks up
contaminants (organic and inorganic chemicals, metals,
biological waste products of decomposition) just as water
picks up coffee in the coffee maker.
• This water with the dissolved contaminants is called
leachate and is typically acidic.
31

•

The liquid that collects at the bottom of a landfill is
known as leachate.

•

Leachate contains a variety of chemical constituents:
» derived from the solublization of the materials
deposited in the landfill,
» and from the products of the chemical and biochemical
reactions occurring within the landfill.

•

In general, leachate is a result of:
» the percolation of precipitation through surface soil,
» uncontrolled runoff, and
» irrigation water into the landfill.

•

Leachate can also include water initially contained in the
waste as well as infiltrating groundwater.
32

• To collect leachate, perforated pipes run throughout the
landfill.
• These pipes then drain into a leachate pipe, which carries
leachate to a leachate collection pond (Figure 7.8).
• The leachate in the pond is tested for acceptable levels of
various chemicals (biological and chemical oxygen
demands, organic chemicals, pH, calcium, magnesium, iron,
sulfate and chloride) and allowed to settle.
• After testing, the leachate must be treated like any other
sewage/wastewater; the treatment may occur on-site or offsite.
• In deep landfills, leachate is collected at intermediate points.
33

Figure 7.8 A leachate collection pond is designed to catch the contaminants
that can get into water that goes through the trash in a landfill.

34

(vi) Landfill Gas Collection System
•

Landfill gas is the mixture of gases found within a landfill
due to various reactions taking place in the landfill.

•

The bulk of landfill gas consists of:
»
»

methane (CH4), and
carbon dioxide (CO2),

the principal products of the anaerobic decomposition of
the biodegradable organic fraction of the MSW in the
landfill.
•

Other components of landfill gas include:
»
»
»
»

atmospheric nitrogen, and
oxygen,
ammonia, and
trace organic compounds.

35

• Methane Collection System
• Bacteria in the landfill break down the trash in the absence
of oxygen (anaerobic) because the landfill is airtight.
• A byproduct of this anaerobic breakdown is landfill gas,
which contains approximately 50 percent methane and 50
percent carbon dioxide with small amounts of nitrogen and
oxygen.
• This presents a hazard because the methane can explode
and/or burn.
• So, the landfill gas must be removed.
• To do this, a series of pipes are embedded (inserted) within
the landfill to collect the gas (Figure 7.9).
• In some landfills, this gas is vented or burned (Figure 7.10).
36

Figure 7.9 A methane collection pipe helps capture the hazardous gas
37

Figure 7.10 A methane "flare" is used for burning landfill gas
38

• More recently, it has been recognized that this landfill gas
represents a usable energy source.
• The methane can be extracted from the gas and used as
fuel.
• As an example in a municipal solid waste landfill in USA,
a company collects the landfill gas, extracts the methane,
and sells it to a nearby chemical company to power its
boilers.
• The extraction system is a split system, meaning that
methane gas can go to the boilers and/or the methane
flares that burn the gas.

39

• The reason for the split system is that the landfill will
increase its gas production over time (from 300 cubic feet
per minute to 1,250 cubic feet per minute) and thus would
exceed the capacity of the boilers at the chemical
company.
• Therefore, the excess gas will have to be burned.
• It is not cost-effective to compress the excess gas to liquid
and sell it.
(vii) Covering or Cap
• As mentioned above, each cell is covered daily with six
inches of compacted soil.
40

• This covering seals the compacted trash from the air and
prevents pests (birds, rats, mice, flying insects, etc.) from
getting into the trash.
• This soil takes up quite a bit of space.
• Because space is a precious commodity, many landfills are
experimenting with tarps or spray coverings of paper or
cement/paper emulsions.
• These emulsions can effectively cover the trash, but take
up only a quarter of an inch instead of 6 inches!
• Figure 7.11 shows an experimental tarp provides daily
cover of the landfill cells
• Figures 7.12 -7.13 show the cross sectional diagrams of a
modern sanitary landfill
41

Figure 7.11 An experimental tarp provides daily cover of the
landfill cells.
42

Figure 7.12 Cross Section of a Modern Sanitary
Landfill

43

Figure 7.13 Cross Section of a Modern Sanitary
Landfill
44

• The final lift includes the cover layer which is
applied to the entire landfill surface after all
landfilling operations are complete.
• The final cover usually consists of multiple
layers of soil and/or geomembrane materials
designed to:
» enhance surface drainage,
» intercept percolating water, and
» support surface vegetation.

45

• When a section of the landfill is finished, it is covered
permanently with a polyethylene cap (40 mil).
• The cap is then covered with a 2-foot layer of compacted
soil.
• The soil is then planted with vegetation to prevent erosion
of the soil by rainfall and wind (Figure 7.14).
• The vegetation consists of grass and kudzu.
• No trees, shrubs or plants with deep penetrating roots are
used so that the plant roots do not contact the underlying
trash and allow leachate out of the landfill.

46

Figure 7.14 Grass and other plants cover the municipal solid waste
landfill.
47

• The goal for the design and operation of a modern landfill is
to eliminate or minimize the impacts associated with these
concerns.

7.4 Landfill Classification, Types, and
Methods
• The purpose of this section is to introduce the
(1) a commonly used landfill classification system,
(2) the different types of landfills that are now used, and
(3) the different landfilling methods that are used in various parts of
world.

48

7.4.1 Classification of Landfills
• Although a number of landfill classification systems have
been proposed over the years, the classification system
adopted by the state of California in USA in 1984 is
perhaps the most widely accepted classification system for
landfills.
• In the California system, three classifications are used as
shown below :
__________________________________

Classification

Type of waste

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I
II
III

Hazardous waste
Designated waste
Municipal solid waste (MSW)

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

49

• Designated wastes are nonhazardous wastes that may
release constituents in concentrations that exceed applicable
water quality objectives.
• Note that this classification system focuses primarily on the
protection of surface and groundwater rather than landfill
gas migration or air quality.

7.4.2 Major Types of Landfills
• The principal types of landfills can be classified as:
(1) conventional landfills for commingled MSW,
(2) landfills for shredded (milled) solid wastes, and
(3) monofills for designated or specialized wastes.

50

(1) Landfills for Commingled MSW
• The majority of the landfills throughout the United States
are designed for commingled MSW.
• In many of these Class III landfills, limited amounts of
nonhazardous industrial wastes and sludge from water and
wastewater treatment plants are also accepted.
• In many states, treatment plant sludges are accepted if they
are dewatered to a solids content of 51 percent or greater.
• In most cases, native soil is used as the intermediate and
final cover material.

51

• However, in locations where the amount of native soil
available for use as intermediate cover material is limited,
alternative materials such as:
» compost produced from yard wastes and MSW,
» foam,
» old rugs and carpeting,
» dredging spoils, and
» demolition wastes

have been used for the purpose.
• To obtain additional landfill capacity, abandoned and or
closed landfills in some locations are being reused by
excavating the decomposed material to recover the metals
and using the decomposed residue as daily cover for the
new wastes.
• In some cases, the decomposed wastes are excavated and
stockpiled, and a liner is installed before the landfill is
reactivated.
52

(2) Landfills for Shredded Solid Wastes
• An alternative method of landfilling that is being tried in
several U.S. locations involves shredding of the solid wastes
before placement in a landfill.
• Shredded (or milled) waste can be placed at up to 35 percent
greater density than unshredded waste, and without daily
cover in some state regulations.
• Blowing litter, odors, flies, and rats have not been
significant problems.
• Because shredded waste can be compacted to a tighter and
more uniform surface, a reduced amount of soil cover or
some other cover material may be sufficient to control
infiltration of water during the fill operation.
53

• Disadvantages of this method include the need for a
shredding facility and the need to operate a conventional
landfill section for wastes that cannot be easily shredded.
• The shredded waste method has potential application in
areas:
» where landfill capacity is very expensive (because of
the greater compaction obtainable),
» where suitable cover material is not readily available,
and
» where precipitation is very low or highly seasonal.

• Shredded waste can also be used to produce compost that
can be used as intermediate cover material.
54

(3) Landfills for Individual Waste Constituents
• Landfills for individual waste constituents are known as
monofills.
• Combustion ash, asbestos, and other similar wastes, often
identified as designated wastes, are typically placed in
monofills to isolate them from materials placed in MSW
landfills.
• Because combustion ash contains small amounts of
unburned organic material, the production of odors from the
reduction of sulfate has been a problem in monofills used
for combustion ash.
• In monofills used for combustion ash, the installation of a
gas recovery system is recommended to control odor
problems.
55

7.4.3 Other Types of Landfills
• In addition to the conventional methods of landfilling
already described, other specialized methods of landfilling
designed to enhance different goals of landfill management
are being developed.
• Alternative operational methods that are being used include:
(i) landfills designed to maximize the rate of landfill gas
generation, and
(ii) landfills operated as integrated solid waste treatment
units.
(iii) landfills in wetland areas
• The practice of landfilling in wetland areas, now prohibited,
56
is also described.

(i) Landfills Designed to Maximize Gas Production
• If the quantity of landfill gas that is produced and recovered
from the anaerobic decomposition of solid wastes is to be
maximized, specialized landfill designs will be required.
• For example, the use of deep, individually lined cells, in
which the wastes are placed without intermediate layers of
cover material and leachate is recycled to enhance the
biological decomposition process, is a viable option.
• A possible disadvantage of such a landfill is that excess
leachate must ultimately be disposed of.

57

(ii) Landfills as Integrated Treatment Units
• In this method of operation, the organic constituents would
be separated out and placed in a separate landfill where the
biodegradation rates would be enhanced by increasing the
moisture content of the waste, either by recycling leachate
or by seeding with digested wastewater treatment plant
sludge or animal manure.
• The degraded material would be excavated and used as
cover material for new fill areas, and the excavated cell
would be filled with new waste.

58

(iii) Landfills in Wetland Areas
• In the past, landfilling in wetland areas, such as swamps,
marshes, and tidal areas, was considered acceptable if
adequate drainage was provided and if nuisance conditions
did not develop.
• Under current federal regulations, such destruction of
wetland areas is prohibited, although the expansion of an
existing landfill may be allowed under special conditions.
• Because many landfills already exist in these areas, a brief
description of the methods typically used in these fills is
presented.
• The usual practice in filling wetlands was to divide the area
into cells or lagoons and schedule the filling operations so
that one individual cell or lagoon would be filled each year.
59

• Often, solid wastes were placed directly in the water.
• Alternatively, clean fill material was added up to, or
slightly above the water level before waste filling
operations were started.
• To withstand mud waves and to increase structural
stability, dikes dividing the cells or lagoons were
constructed with trees, tree limbs, lumber, demolition
wastes, and similar materials in addition to clean fill
material.
• In some cases, to prevent the movement of leachate and
gases from completed cells or lagoons, clay and
lightweight interlocking steel or wood-sheet piling has
been used.
60

7.5 Landfilling Methods
• The principal methods used for the landfilling of MSW
are:
(1) excavated cell/trench,
(2) area, and
(3) canyon.

• The principal features of these types of landfills,
illustrated in Figures 7.15 – 7.17 are described below.
(1) Excavated Cell/Trench Method
• The excavated cell/trench method of landfilling (Figure
7.15 ) is ideally suited to areas where an adequate depth
of cover material is available at the site and where the
water table is not near the surface.

61

• The trench method involves digging a wide, long hole in
the existing ground so that the bottom of the trench is much
lower than the surrounding ground level.
• Typically, solid wastes are placed in cells or trenches
excavated in the soil.
• The soil excavated from the site is temporarily stockpiled,
and is later used for daily and final cover.
• The excavated cells or trenches are usually lined with
synthetic membrane liners or low-permeability clay or a
combination of the two to limit the movement of both
landfill gases and leachate.
• Excavated cells are typically square, up to 1000 ft in width
and length, with side slopes of 1.5:1 to 2:1.
• Trenches vary from 200 to 1000 ft in length, 3 to 10 ft in
depth, and 15 to 50 ft in width.
62

Figure 7.15 The Trench Method of Landfill
63

• The waste is placed on the landfill liner, spread in layers,
and driven over with compaction equipment.
• Successive layers are built up until a depth of 3 to 4 m is
achieved.
(2) Area Method
• The area method is used when the terrain is unsuitable for
the excavation of cells or trenches in which to place the
solid wastes (Figure 7.16).
• High-groundwater conditions necessitate the use of areatype landfills.
• Site preparation includes the installation of a liner and
leachate control system.
64

Figure 7.16 The Area Method of Landfill
65

• Cover material must be hauled in by truck or earthmoving
equipment from adjacent land or from borrow-pit areas.
• As noted above, in locations with limited availability of
material that can be used as cover, compost produced from
yard wastes and MSW has been used successfully as
intermediate cover material.
• Other techniques that have been used include the use of
movable temporary cover materials such as soil and
geomembranes.
• Soil and geomembranes, placed temporarily over a
completed cell, can be removed before the next lift is
begun.
66

(3) Cayon/Depression Method
• The canyon method is similar to the trench method except
natural depressions or canyons are used rather than digging
trenches.
• This can include filling old quarry sites.
• Canyons, ravines, dry borrow pits, and quarries have been
used for landfills (Figures 7.17 – 7.18).
• The techniques to place and compact solid wastes in
canyon/depression landfills vary with:
» the geometry of the site,
» the characteristics of the available cover material,
» the hydrology and geology of the site,
» the type of leachate and gas control facilities to be
used, and
» the access to the site.
67

Figure 7.17 The Canyon Method of Landfill
68

Figure 7.18 The Canyon Method of Landfill

69

• Control of surface drainage often is a critical factor in the
development of canyon/depression sites.
• Typically, filling for each lift starts at the head end of the
canyon and ends at the mouth, so as to prevent the
accumulation of water behind the landfill.
• Canyon/depression sites are filled in multiple lifts, and the
method of operation is essentially the same as the area
method described above.
• If a canyon floor is reasonably flat, the initial landfilling
may be carried out using the excavated cell/trench method
discussed previously.
70

• A key to the successful use of the canyon/depression
method is the availability of adequate material to cover the
individual lifts as they are completed and to provide a final
cover over the entire landfill when the final height is
reached.
• Cover material is excavated from the canyon walls or floor
before the liner system is installed.
• Borrow pits and abandoned quarries may not contain
sufficient soil for intermediate cover, so that cover material
may have to be imported.
• Compost produced from yard waste and MSW can be used
for the intermediate cover layers.
71
